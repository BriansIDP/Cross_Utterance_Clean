AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0006879_0007304 UM AND A S I THINK THE SEARCH WORKS AS WELL SO YOU COULD POP UP A SEARCH
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007304_0007975 AND IT LOADS UP UM JUST THE BACKGROUND WINDOW IS EMPTY AND UM SO WHEN YOU START
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007975_0008475 YOU HAVE TO EITHER OPEN OPEN A PARTICULAR OBSERVATION OR DO A SEARCH AND OPEN IT THROUGH THAT
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008648_0008707 DOES THAT MAKE SENSE
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008861_0009603 UM THE TRANSCRIPTION BOX HAS GOT A SUMMARISE BUT BUTTON WHICH DOESN'T DO ANYTHING YET

AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012838 BUT SO LIKE YOU CLICK ON A BUTTON AND THEN THAT OPENS WHATEVER THAT SPEAKER CHARACTERISATION IS
AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012838_0013481 THE PROBLEM IS THE R THE LEFT CLICK IS ALREADY USED BECAUSE IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT UM

AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0071292_0071717 MY EXPERIENCE HAS ONLY BEEN BEING GIVEN THE REMOTE CONTROL WITH THE OBJECT I BUY

AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0077978_0078326 ACTUALLY THAT JUST RAISES A POINT I WONDER WHAT OUR DESIGN PEOPLE THINK
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0078326_0078704 BUT YOU KNOW ON A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN PRESS A KEY AND IT GIVES YOU A MENU
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0078704_0079448 IT'S GOT A MENU DISPLAY I WONDER IF INCORPORATING THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF A REMOTE CONTROL MIGHT BE USEFUL SO YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE L. C. D. DISPLAY
AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0080380_0080592 WITH MENUS YEAH YEAH

AMI_ES2004a_H03_FEE016_0094012_0094353 IT COULD HAVE A FLIP TOP REMOTE CONTROL SO THAT WHEN YOU FLIP OVER THE TOP

AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0062515_0063547 JUST A COUPLE OF VALUABLE POINTS AND STARTED DEVELOPING ON THAT AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISSING LOOPS IN THIS THING WHICH I THINK WE'LL UH TAKE A FEEDBACK FROM THE MARKETING BECAUSE
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0063691_0064255 UM I HAVEN'T HAD SOME MARKETING DATA AND BASICALLY EVERY PRODUCT IS MARKETABLE
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064255_0064919 SO PURPOSE AS WILLIAM ALREADY SAID I WOULD PUT IT TO SIMPLIFY THE INTERACTION WITH T. V. TO MAKE MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064919_0065298 AND TO SUMMARISE I I WOULD SAY IT'S IT SHOULD BE USER FRIENDLY BY BEING EASY TO USE
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0065404_0066192 RATHER THAN HAVING A LOT OF COMPLEX BUTTON BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE AN ENGINEERING MAYBE HAVING HUNDRED BUTTONS AND MAYBE HAVING UH A REMOTE CONTROL WHICH HAS THE MAIN FEATURES
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066315_0066622 LIKE VOLUME CONTROL OR CHANNEL CH CHANGING THE CHANNEL OR WHATEVER
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066741_0067462 BUT WE ARE TO TO MAKE IT UNIQUE SO THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BUY IT WILL THIS TWO FEATURES TOGETHER
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0067462_0067737 SO WHAT THE CONCEPT IS TO HAVE A FLIP TOP MODEL
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0067737_0069035 THE MAIN FUNCTIONS SUCH AS WHICH ARE LIKE OFTEN USED WILL BE ON THE TOP AND THE COMPLEX FUNCTIONS WHICH SAY YOU YOU CAN SAY LIKE THE Y YOUNG GENERATION OR TRENDY GENERATION WANT TO PR SAY PROGRAMME THEIR FAVOURITE CHANNELS OR WHATEVER
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0069035_0069351 CAN BE PUT IN THE MIDDLE PART OF THE F FLIP TOP
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0069351_0070654 SO IT'S LIKE IT COULD BE ACCESSED BY A WIDE RA RANGE OF UH AUDIENCE AND WE CAN PUNCH IN NEW F FEATURES SUCH AS UH ADDED FEATURES SUCH AS SHOCK PROOF BODY AND MAYBE A DESIGN TO APPEAL TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0070826_0072814 FINDINGS MOST PEOPLE PREFER US USER FRIENDLY RATHER THAN COMPLEX REMOTE CONTROLS BECAUSE THERE ARE TIMES LIKE UH PEOPLE HAVE USED A REMOTE CONTROL FOR SAY A YEAR OR SOMETHING AND THEY THEY ARE NOT USED MAYBE THIRTY TO FORTY PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO IT'S NOT OF NO USE OF PUNCHING IN THE UH TRYING TO PUT IN THOSE THINGS IN ON THE TOP OF THE REMOTE CONTROL AND TRY TO CONFUSE THE USER
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0072814_0073649 AS WE SAW WE WE HAVE TO MAKE A PROFIT ALSO SO WE WE CAN MAYBE GO FOR AN ECONOMIES OF A HIGHER PRODUCTION MM BY FIFTY MILLION WE SAID
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0073649_0074378 YEAH WITH THAT I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE ALSO SO WE CAN GIVE IN ADD IN MORE FEATURES AND MAKE IT LESS COSTLY

AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0074762_0075212 THAT'S SO THIS IS IF YOU ASK ME PERSONALLY I WOULD MAKE UH
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0075447_0076762 FLIP TOP WITH A TRENDY UH UH DESIGN AND S MAYBE WE WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALSO LIKE THE BUTTONS WHE WHETHER THEY ARE LIKE SOFT OR LITTLE HARD BECAUSE THEY ARE TIMES WHEN THE BUTTONS TEND TO BE A BIT HARD AFTER UH CONTINUOUS USE USAGE AND ALL THAT
AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0076762_0076903 SO IN OVERALL A SIMPLE AND UH

AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166940_0167575 IT IS AFTER UM IF YOU LOOK IN THE NEWSPAPER T. V. GUIDE OR ANY T. V. GUIDE THERE'S A FIVE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0167575_0169104 SIX DIGIT NUMBER AFTERWARDS AND THAT'S THE NUMBER YOU PUT IN AND IT'S RECORDED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ON ON TUESDAYS AT TEN O'CLOCK ON THE SEVENTEENTH SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DATES AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TIMES
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169104_0169455 UM AND IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR QUITE A LONG TIME
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169712_0170288 NO IT'S NOT UM BUT I THINK IF AWARENESS WAS KIND OF BROUGHT TO THE FOREFRONT ABOUT THAT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0171146_0171179 MM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0172221_0172299 OKAY SO
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0174856_0174898 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0179443_0180041 THE FUNCTIONALITY OF IT IN THE SENSE THAT YOU'RE SITTING THERE YOU'RE PRESSING THIS BUTTON AND YOUR T. V. 'S NOT DOING IT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0180125_0180592 TAKING YOUR T. V. AND YOUR CONTROL AND SAYING LOOK THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING IT'S NOT WORKING WHAT SHOULD I DO
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181366_0181542 I THINK SO
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181542_0181612 UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181827_0181972 INSTRUCTION MANUALS
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181972_0182307 BUT I MEAN THEY'RE THERE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0182307_0183125 THERE WILL BE A CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER THING THAT YOU CAN PHONE UP AND SPEAK TO AND THAT WAY THERE'S NO CALL OUT CHARGE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0183125_0183634 THERE'S NO EXTRA T THE PERSON HAS TO WALK TO A SHOP ON THE HIGH STREET UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0184407_0184469 MM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0184469_0185430 BUT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON MAKING THE MANUAL AS USER FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE JUST TINY LITTLE WRITING AND LOTS AND LOTS OF PAGES
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185430_0185816 IT DOES YOU JUST PUT IT IN THE DRAWER UNTIL SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND THEN YOU TRY AND SEARCH THROUGH IT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185816_0186123 SO THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING WE THINK ABOUT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186123_0186346 UM WHAT OTHER FUNCTIONS
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186346_0186957 WE NEED I'M NOT SURE IF WE NEED A DESIGN UM DECISION NOW
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0186957_0187714 BUT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT C 'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT THE DILEMMA BETWEEN OH BATTERIES THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0187714_0187922 MOBILE PHONE BATTERIES WHAT KINDA BATTERY IS THAT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0188854_0189772 WELL THEY LA THEY THEY LAST QUITE A LONG TIME AND IF YOU HAD UH WHEN YOU TH THE THING THAT YOU GET WITH MOBILE HOUSE PHONES
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0189772_0190169 YOU SIT IT IN ITS CHARGER WHEN YOU'RE NOT USING IT OR T AT NIGHT OR SOMETHING
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190169_0190674 BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER 'CAUSE IT NEVER REALLY RUNS OUT 'CAUSE IT LASTS A LONG TIME ONCE IT IS CHARGED
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0190674_0191003 UM SOMETHING LIKE THAT SHOULD REDUCE THE SIZE OF IT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0191820_0192107 YEAH IT COULD BE ON THAT YEAH OKAY
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0192251_0192283 S

AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193074_0193261 SO THE RECHARGEABLE WHICH WOULD BE YOUR

AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193613_0193667 OKAY
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0193952_0194291 YES WHICH IT IS CHEAPER IN THE LONG RUN AS WELL
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194291_0194770 UM TH THE SHAPE YOU GOT TRENDY
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0194770_0195498 I DON'T WANNA BIG BOX WITH LOTS OF THINGS YOU DON'T WANT A TINY SORT OF LITTLE THING EITHER
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0195498_0196249 BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE GOT THE REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY NO MATTER HOW MANY HOW MUCH YOU TRY AND MAKE IT SIMPLE UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0196609_0196676 THEY DO
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0197718_0197875 OKAY SO WE'VE GOT A FLIP SCREEN
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0198008_0198088 UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0200598_0200653 OKAY

AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0202401_0202451 OKAY
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0202640_0203026 CAN YOU LOOK INTO THE COMPANY LOGO
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0203150_0204079 UM THINGS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY IN VIEW TO TRYING TO INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE PRODUCT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0204079_0204130 I MEAN
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0204322_0205260 FOR EXAMPLE IF IT WAS A C. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU COULD HAVE IT IN A VAGUE C. SHAPE THAT OPENS UP KIND OF LIKE A SHELL
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0205260_0205875 OR SOMETHING UM SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES TO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE IT QUITE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0206040_0206644 UM OBVIOUSLY INTO THE DESIGN WHILE ALSO MAKING IT QUITE DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING ELSE THAT'S THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0208341_0208598 WELL WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA LOOK DIFFERENT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212165_0212769 OR YOU COULD DO UM DIFFERENT LIKE YOU GET WITH MOBILE PHONES DIFFERENT FASCIAS
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0212769_0213100 YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT KIND OF CASINGS
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0213100_0213867 SO YOU COULD HAVE LIKE PSYCHEDELIC ONES FOR YOUNGER PEOPLE AND SLEEK ONES AND
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0214298_0214358 YEAH
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0215325_0215373 MM

AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0216498_0216776 RIGHT I THINK WE HAVE TO ROUND IT UP UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0216885_0216925 SURE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0218236_0219067 THAT WAS UM IN CUTTING DOWN THE NUMBER THAT WAS KINDA SEPARATE THAT WAS CUTTING DOWN THE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0219067_0219618 MAKING IT SIMPLER SO INSTEAD OF HAVING LOTS OF THINGS YOU PUT IN FOR DATE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0220670_0221444 IT'S KINDA TAKES THE PLACE OF HAVING A BUTTON TO PRESS FOR THE DATE AND HAVING THE BUTTON TO PRESS FOR THE CHANNEL THINGS LIKE THAT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221444_0221589 UM IT COULD BE IT C
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0221657_0222602 IT YES IT COULD BE UH ADV ADVERTISEMENT FEATURE UM RATHER THAN DESIGN FEATURE YOU KNOW DRAWING ATTENTION TO THAT
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0222671_0223557 AND IT ALSO PAID UM LIP SERVICE IN THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL 'CAUSE IT'S VERY SIMPLE SO PUTTING IT DOWN IN WORDS SHOULD BE HELPFUL
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0223711_0223742 YEAH
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0223912_0224048 UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0224964_0225675 WE'VE GOT THE BUTTONS BUT I THINK WE'LL WORK THROUGH THAT WITH THE DESIGN OF IT UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0225927_0226009 YES
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0226009_0226084 YES
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0226198_0226844 AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT UM THERE BEING AN ALARM OR SOMETHING A BEEPING FOR BEING LOST UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227005_0227308 LEARNING HOW TO USE IT SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0227308_0228085 BUT THERE AREN'T GONNA BE THAT FUNC THAT MANY FUNCTIONS INCORPORATED INTO IT SO IT SHOULD BE FINE AND THE I THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228085_0228384 I DON'T KNOW IF WE DEAL WITH THAT UM
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228594_0228670 I THINK
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0228984_0229266 YEP AND DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S OUT THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0229266_0229414 YEP I THINK THAT'S US

AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0020998_0021062 YEP THERE WE GO
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021250_0021849 OKAY THIS IS UH THE WORKING DESIGN PRESENTED BY ME THE UH INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER EXTRAORDINAIRE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021996_0022501 'KAY THIS IS WHERE I WENT A BIT MAD WITH POWERPOINT SO
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022501_0022885 WHAT THE FIRST THING QUESTION I ASKED WAS WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DESIGN
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022885_0023358 WELL A DEVICE WHICH BASICALLY JUST SENDS THE SIGNAL TO THE T. V. TO CHANGE ITS STATE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023358_0023844 WHETHER THAT BE THE POWER OR THE CHANNEL UM OR THE VOLUME
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023844_0024692 EVERYTHING IS JUST UM SOME SORT OF SIGNAL TO CHANGE THE STATE OF THE T. V. OR OTHER APPLIANCE THAT IT'S SENDING THE SIGNAL TO
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0024903_0025738 UM SO I DECIDED I'D HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT TH OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DESIGNED AND TRY AND TAKE SOME INSPIRATION FROM THAT
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0025738_0026006 BUT UH ALTHOUGH WE WILL WANT TO BE TAKING
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0026148_0027208 IDEAS FROM OTHER PEOPLE WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT OUR DESIGN STANDS OUT AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WELL IT WASN'T REALLY MY AREA BECAUSE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027266_0027489 I'M DEALING WITH THE INSIDE REALLY
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027489_0028055 SO UM YEAH I RAN OUT OF TIME SO I COULDN'T DO THIS ONE AS FUN AS THE LAST ONE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0028055_0029482 UM AND UH I FOUND OUT THAT MOST UH CONTROLS USE SOME FORM OF INFRARED TO SEND SIGNALS TO THE T. V. PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF THE COST ISSUE OF UH SOMETHING LIKE UH THE SAME THING THAT COMPUTERS USE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029482_0029852 WIRELESS AND YOU DON'T NEED TO SEND VERY MUCH INFORMATION
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029852_0030249 UM MOST OF THEM ARE POWERED BY SOME FORM OF BATTERY
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0030249_0030387 NOW OUR ONE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0030387_0032173 I'M I'M NOT SURE WHETHER WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE SIZE ISSUE BECAUSE MOST OF THEM ARE POWERED BY TRIPLE A. BATTERIES BUT THOSE CAN BE QUITE BULKY SO I D I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WANTED TO LOOK AT SOMETHING ELSE UM SO WE COULD SHRINK DOWN THE SIZE OF THE CONTROL
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032173_0032222 YEAH SURE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032558_0032617 UM NO NO
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032617_0033253 IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT IF YOU LOOK AT MOST REMOTE CONTROLS THEY'RE QUITE THEY'RE QUITE CHUNKY AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE BATTERIES
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033253_0033769 THEY HAVE TO BE OBVIOUSLY THIS CERTAIN SIZE TO FIT THOSE BATTERIES IN
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033769_0034754 YEAH THE THE WELL YOU CAN YOU CAN GET THE SORT OF CIRCULAR ROUND ONES BUT I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT POWER CONSUMPTION AND HOW MUCH YOU NEED TO SEND THE DATA ACROSS
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0034754_0035461 UM AND D WHICH LEADS SORT OF ONTO THE NEXT POINT ABOUT 'EM BEING SMALL AND EASY TO CARRY ROUND
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0035461_0036032 UM NOW THE ONES AT THE MOMENT ARE SMALL BUT I WAS JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD LOOK AT SOMETHING A BIT SMALLER
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036119_0036880 NOW THE MAIN COMPONENTS I CAME UP WITH UM WERE OBVIOUSLY THE POWER SOURCE FOR THE BATTERIES 'CAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036880_0037334 UH AS I SAID ABOUT THE W WHICH BATTERIES WE WERE GONNA CHOOSE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0037334_0039212 WE CAN UH DISCUSS THAT LATER AND THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED SOMETHING TO DECODE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN FROM FROM THE CONTROLLER AND TO TURN IT INTO AN I UH INFRARED SIGNAL WHICH WE'RE GOING TO USE TO SEND THE INFORMATION
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0039212_0040149 NOW THESE HAVE A WIRELESS RANGE OF UP TO ABOUT FIVE METRES WHICH IS SORT OF SUITABLE FOR ANYONE WHO'S WATCHING THE T. V. UNLESS THEY'RE IN A CINEMA
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0040149_0040724 WHICH NOT MOST PEOPLE DO SO AS WE'RE APPLYING TO THE MOST AUDIENCE THAT SHOULD BE FINE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0040724_0041786 AND THEN I WAS UH JUST HAD A QUICK LOOK AT THE EXTERNAL DESIGN BUT I D I LEFT THAT MOSTLY TO THE UH INTERFACE DESIGNER
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0041918_0042276 AND SO THIS IS WHAT I HAD AS THE BASIC IDEA OF WHAT WE WANNA DO
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042276_0042828 IT'S NOT A PROPER CIRCUIT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'D WORK OR NOT
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042828_0043307 I'M NOT EVEN CONFIDENT THAT THOSE ARE THE REAL UM THE REAL WAY YOU'D WIRE IT UP BUT ANYWAY
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0043307_0044180 WE'VE JUST GOT THE THE POWER GOING TO THE INFRARED BULB WITH THE CHIP AND THE UH U. I. INTERFACE UM
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044335_0044440 WHICH WOULD BASICALLY
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044440_0045351 WHEN YOU WHEN YOU PRESSED ANYTHING IT WOULD THE CHIP WOULD CONVERT IT INTO SOME FORM OF I. R. DATA WHICH COULD BE DECODED BY THE T. V. RECEIVER
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0045351_0045881 WHICH OBVIOUSLY MEANS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONFORM TO WHATEVER
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0045992_0047240 UM WHATEVER FORM OF COMMUNICATION THAT THE T. V. S ARE ALREADY USING AND SINCE THAT THAT'S ANOTHER USE AND REASON TO USE THAT INFRARED BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT ALL T. V. S USE AT THE MOMENT
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0047240_0047388 AND THEN FINALLY
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0047388_0048772 UM WE WANT UH THE IT TO BE AVAILABLE TO A WIDE AUDIENCE AT A LOW COST SO ALL THE COMPONENTS THAT I'VE PUT FORWARD ARE UH LOW IN COST SO THAT THAT SHOULD BE GOOD
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0048772_0049534 UM IT SHOULD SHOULD BE DIFFERENT ENOUGH UM FROM THE ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS TO GET A GOOD CONSUMER BASE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0049534_0049953 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BEFORE AND ALSO JUST SOMETHING THAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0049953_0051225 UH BECAUSE THEY'RE SMALL THEY'RE ALSO EASY TO LOSE SO IF WE COULD LOOK INTO SOME WAY OF D DUNNO SOME ANTI GOING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE SOFA THING THAT YOU COULD HAVE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051225_0051707 I TH THAT WAS JUST SORT OF A GENERAL POINT THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0051707_0051903 AND THAT'S UH YEAH
AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0052171_0052865 ALRIGHT OKAY AND YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CAME UP WITH THERE SO IF YOU WANNA

AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0084171_0084387 GET IT RIGHT OVER OKAY THANK YOU
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0084563_0085725 OKAY UM I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FROM THE MARKETING POINT OF VIEW AND UH OBVIOUSLY OUR STARTING POINT WITH MARKETING IS ALWAYS MARKET RESEARCH
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0085725_0086149 UM SO THAT'S WHERE WE STARTED WE USED OUR OUR USABILITY LAB
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086149_0086670 THE COMPANY'S USABILITY LAB WE DID OUR USUAL SELECTION METHODS TO GET A CROSS SECTION OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086670_0087219 MALE AND FEMALE ALL AGE GROUPS FROM FIFTEEN UPWARDS AND UM WE OBSERVED THEM IN THE LAB
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087219_0087626 JUST THEIR GENERAL USE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL YOU CAN SEE WE HAD A HUNDRED SUBJECTS THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087633_0088097 OUR FINDINGS LOTS OF FINDINGS I'VE JUST SUMMARISED SOME OF THEM HERE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088097_0088814 THE OVERALL THING WHICH I'VE I'VE GOT AT THE TOP THERE IN ITALICS IS THAT USERS DISLIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088814_0089076 SO IT HAS OBVIOUS DESIGN IMPLICATIONS THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089076_0089559 UM WE FOUND THAT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS FIND MOST REMOTE CONTROLS UGLY
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089695_0090332 EIGHTY PERCENT WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY WHEN A REMOTE CONTROL WOULD LOOK FANCY WE WERE QUITE SURPRISED BY THAT FINDING
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0090332_0091220 BUT UM THAT'S QUITE A HIGH PROPORTION OF OUR OUR YOU KNOW INTERNATIONAL TARGET GROUP ARE PREPARED TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT'S A BIT NICER LOOKING
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091220_0091790 UM CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS DO NOT MATCH WELL WITH THE OPERATING BEHAVIOUR OF THE USER OVERALL
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091790_0092588 FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SEE BELOW THERE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF USERS ZAP A LOT SO YOU'VE GOT YOUR PERSON SUNK BACK IN THE SOFA CHANNEL HOPPING
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092588_0092783 SO AGAIN THERE'S POWER IMPLICATIONS THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092792_0093454 UM FIFTY PERCENT OF USERS ONLY USE TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS SO AGAIN A BIG DESIGN ISSUE THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0093454_0094252 UM AND POSSIBLY WE CAN ALSO CUT BACK ON COST IF WE DON'T HAVE SO MANY FUNCTIONS ACTUALLY ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0094252_0094305 UM
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0094690_0095591 THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS THAT PEOPLE FOUND WITH REGARD TO PERSONAL PREFERENCES WERE UM SOMETHING THAT YOU YOU MENTIONED EARLIER UH REMOTE CONTROLS ARE OFTEN LOST IN THE ROOM
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0095591_0096272 IT'S A SLIPPING DOWN THE BACK OF THE SOFA TYPE OF THING UH FIFTY PERCENT WERE WERE PARTICULARLY FRUSTRATED BY THAT
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0096272_0097238 UH THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF PEOPLE TAKE SAID THEY TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN TO USE AND I THINK THAT TIES IN WITH THE UM THE PREVIOUS FINDING OF PEOPLE ONLY USING TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097238_0097521 THEY JUST CAN'T BE BOTHERED TO LEARN ABOUT THE OTHER FUNCTIONS
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097607_0098356 UM UM SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A QUARTER OF PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BAD FOR UH REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098356_0098896 YOU KNOW THOSE SMALL MOVEMENTS OF THE REMOTE CONTROL CAN LEAD TO KIND OF SHOULDER AND ELBOW PROBLEMS
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098896_0099689 UM THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE THIRTY FIVE AND UNDER AGE GROUP WOULD LIKE UM A LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY AND SPEECH RECOGNITION
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0099689_0100431 AGAIN THAT WAS TO AID I THINK IN UH WHEN THEY'VE LOST THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL SOME KIND OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100431_0100548 SOMETHING WE DIDN'T PUT TO THEM
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100548_0101364 BUT WHICH I'M THINKING OF NOW IS UM EVEN IF PERHAPS THE LOST CONTROL CAN GIVE OFF A BLEEP EVERY NOW AND AGAIN TIL YOU FIND IT OR A FLASHING LIGHT
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101364_0101496 POSSIBLY
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101496_0101820 UM THAT TREND REVERSES IN THE OLDER AGE GROUPS
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101820_0102050 SO THIRTY FIVES AND UNDERS WHO WOULD LIKE THOSE TWO FEATURES
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102050_0102645 THAT KIND OF EVENS OUT THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE AND IN THE OLDER AGE GROUP IT KIND OF REVERSES THEY'RE NOT SO BOTHERED WITH THIS
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102724_0103167 I HAD MARVELLOUS TABLES AND THINGS THAT I COULD SHOW YOU BUT I THINK I'LL JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0103167_0103614 IF THERE'S ANY MORE INFORMATION I CAN EMAIL YOU EXTRA DETAILS IS THAT OKAY
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0107683_0108058 MM-HMM SO CAN WE NOT PROGRAMME A VIDEO WITH THIS REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0108448_0108535 JUST CHANNEL HOPPING
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0109768_0109931 WOULD THAT IMPLY VIDEO USE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0110866_0111006 MM-HMM YES
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0112584_0112651 YES
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0113429_0114281 UM WE DIDN'T REALLY LOOK INTO THAT BUT REMEMBER WE FOUND THAT FINDING THAT MOST PEOPLE ONLY USE ABOUT UH TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114281_0114818 I THINK TH TH THOSE DO TEND TO BE THE BASIC CHANNEL HOPPING THINGS AND ON AND OFF FOR THE VIDEO FAST FORWARDING
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114818_0115453 SO ON AND I THINK IT'S SORT OF GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE DO FIND PROGRAMMING THEIR VIDEOS A NIGHTMARE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0115453_0115669 SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0115975_0116027 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0116582_0117240 IN FACT I'VE JUST CALLED UP THAT TABLE THERE WE ASKED THOSE TWO QUESTIONS THE TABLE RELATES TO BOTH QUESTIONS SO WE DIDN'T DIFFERENTIATE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117240_0117928 WOULD YOU PREFER AN L. C. D. SCREEN THAT'S MULTI FUNCTION REMOTE AND WOULD YOU PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117928_0118404 SO YOU CAN SEE HOW THE THE YES NO SORT OF VARIES ACROSS THE AGE GROUP THERE
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0118404_0118899 AND A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF DON'T KNOWS IN THE OLDER AGE GROUP I THINK THAT'S JUST GENERAL FEAR OF NEW TECHNOLOGY
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0119631_0119703 OH YEAH
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0119917_0120003 RIGHT
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0121011_0121055 MM
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0123206_0123255 YES
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0123366_0123469 THAT'S A SUPER IDEA
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0123749_0123795 YEAH
AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0126734_0127142 YES FURTHER MARKET RESEARCH WILL BE NEEDED TO KIND OF FOCUS ON WHAT THAT IS

AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0140389_0140416 OKAY
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148592_0148738 OKAY UH
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0148998_0149237 WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOMETHING WHICH I DID HERE
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149237_0149677 FIRST THING IS UH BASICALLY ON DESIGN WE JUST TOOK THE INPUT FROM THE PREVIOUS MEETING
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149677_0150290 ESPECIALLY FROM THE MARKETING AND INDUSTRIAL DESIGN TO CHECK ON THE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND FEASIBILITY
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150290_0150802 SECOND IS WE CHECKED INTO COMPETITORS THE PICTURE HERE SHOWS ONE OF THE STANDARD MODELS OFFERED BY COMPETITORS HERE
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150802_0151570 SO Y YOU GENERALLY SEE THERE'S NOT MUCH OF VARIETY AND LIKE MARKETING TEAM SAID UH PEOPLE NEED TRENDY THEY ARE BORED OF BLACK AND WHITE
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0151570_0152116 SO YOU GENERALLY SEE RECTANGULAR SHAPE VERY MONOTONOUS KIND OF DESIGNS HERE
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152292_0152729 AND UH SECOND THING IS THERE'S TOO MUCH OF CONFUSION HERE
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152729_0152905 NO PARTICULAR REMOTE IS STANDARD
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153118_0153286 LIKE SOME SOME PEOPLE HAVE A
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153441_0153591 HERE YOU SEE THIS
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153591_0153741 THIS IS ON A I I
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0153858_0154292 I FOUND TH THAT UH ONLY COMMON FEATURE IS THE CH UH CHANNEL CONTROL AND UH VOLUME CONTROL
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154292_0154798 REST OTHER BUTTONS THEY ARE IN A VERY DISORGANIZED AND THEY ARE NOT CONSISTENT TH WITH OTHER MODELS AND ALL
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154928_0155214 OKAY AND SECOND AS ALREADY DISCUSSED WITH WILLIAM
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0155214_0156212 WE ARE GOING TO HAVE M MAYBE A G. G. U. I. INTERFACE IN THE F IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLIP TOP AND G GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE BASICALLY WHICH IS WHAT WE D DO IN COMPUTER
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156212_0156505 HAVE ICONS OR TOUCH PAD OR WHATEVER WHICH IS
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0156891_0157538 LIKE YOU HAVE ON A L UH ICONS OR SOMETHING Y YOU HAVE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF G. U. I. GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0157634_0157921 SO BASICALLY NOT POINT OR CLICK
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158012_0158431 PRESS ANY PARTICULAR DEVICE HE JUST HAS TO CLICK ON THAT PARTICULAR ICON TO SIMPLIFY
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0158431_0159281 AND ON THE TOP M REPETITIVE BUTTONS WHICH ARE LIKE VOLUME OR CHANNEL CHANGING AND ALL COULD BE ON THE POINTING DEVICE THAT MEANS THE USE OF BUTTON
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159281_0159776 SO HE NEED NOT USE A POINTER TO KEEP CHANGING THE CHANNEL IF A PERSON IS FREQUENT SURFER
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159878_0160312 SO WE ARE HAVING A COMBINATION OF BOARDS SO F ON THE S SIMPLER BOARD
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0160312_0160780 ON THE TOP WE HAVE THIS BUTTON RUBBER BUTTONS TO KEEP FREQUENTLY CHANGING THE CHANNELS
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0163680_0163738 BUT
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164082_0164112 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0164344_0164499 OKAY AND YOU MEAN TO THE

AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165562_0165774 SO THE FINDINGS ARE TOO MANY CLUTTERED BUTTONS
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0165863_0166384 REPETITION OF CERTAIN BUT BUTTONS WHICH I ALREADY EXPLAINED EXAMPLE THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL BUTTONS
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166384_0166613 ALL ARE CONFUSING AND IN INCONSISTENT

AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167049_0167557 WHICH MENTIONS THAT OUR DIVISION HAS DEVELOPED A NEW SPEECH RECOGNITION S FEATURE
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167557_0168273 WE HAVE TO CHECK INTO THE FOR FINANCIAL F FEASIBILITY WHETHER WE CAN INCORPORATE IT THIS AT A LOW COST
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0168273_0169125 BUT FOR LIKE WE HAD G UM S RESPONSE FROM THE CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FEATURE OF FINDING IT
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169125_0169527 SO IT COULD BE LIKE WHERE IS THE REMOTE AND THE REMOTE ANSWERS I AM HERE

AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170898_0171243 SO WE WE CAN CHECK INTO THE FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY OF INCORPORATING THIS
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0171623_0172153 MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES WOULD BE LIKE AS ALREADY UH MARKETING DEPARTMENT
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172153_0172555 THEY WANT SOMETHING TO DO WITH FRUIT SO I WOULDN'T SAY THE DESIGN SHOULD BE LIKE A FRUIT
AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172555_0173179 BUT YEAH WE CAN TAKE INSPIRATION FROM FRUIT COLOURS LIKE THE VIBRANT COLOURS UH RED CHILLI UH

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131235_0131449 I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A CONTRAST BETWEEN
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0131449_0132237 IF THE WHOLE THING IS GONNA BE THIS RUBBER THING IT WOULD BE GOOD TO OPEN IT UP AND SEE SOMETHING QUITE FANCY LOOKING INSIDE

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161564_0161743 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT HOLDING IT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0161877_0162283 YOU WOULD BE USING YOUR THUMBS TO PRESS JUST LIKE A MOBILE PHONE
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0163077_0163132 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0163533_0164442 THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST SAYING AND THEN HAVE THE AND THEN HAVE THE L. C. D. AT THE TOP AND THEN BE ABLE TO TOUCH THAT FOR THE OTHER CONTROLS

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0179203_0179843 I'M NOT SURE HOW LONG WE'VE GOT LEFT BUT WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT UM
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180107_0180200 THE THINGS WE'VE DISCUSSED
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180270_0180650 SO WE AGREE ON
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0180781_0180899 DO WE AGREE ON THE BATTERY
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181145_0181306 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181306_0181831 UM THAT MEANS THAT THERE'S NO FUNCTION FOR LI THE PORT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0181831_0182425 YOU KNOW THAT IT SITS IN THEN PRESSING THE BUTTON THEN HAVING SO WE COULD INCORPORATE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE FINDING IT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0182425_0182687 IT'S A BI I IT'S LIKE A G IT'S A GADGET IT'S A
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0182807_0182892 SELLING POINT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0184800_0184921 I THINK THE ONLY
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185031_0185833 I THINK THE ONLY PITFALL THAT WE WOULD HAVE WOULD BE HOW MUCH IT'S GOING TO COST IF THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO CUT DOWN SOMEWHERE ELSE
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185833_0186520 BUT I THINK PRETTY MUCH WE'VE USED CHEAP RELATIVELY CHEAP AND SIMPLE THINGS
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0186520_0186655 THE L. C. D. 'S NOT CHEAP
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0187652_0187765 YEAH OKAY

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191274_0191588 UM OKAY SO WE'VE GOT BATTERY
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0191588_0192062 THE INSIDE COMPONENTS IS PRETTY STANDARDISED ACROSS THE BOARD ISN'T IT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192189_0192592 SO THERE'S NOT A REALLY A DECISION TO BE MADE THERE UM
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192808_0193128 THE BUTTONS WHAT DID YOU GIVE US AS OUR
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0193474_0193716 THE BARE BOARD L. C. D. OR
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0194471_0194948 ON THE TOP ONE OKAY YOU'VE GOT THE TOUCH OKAY AND THEN

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0197336_0197415 NO IT'S FINE
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0198156_0198256 FOR THE INSIDE
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0198780_0198809 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0199200_0199392 OH I THINK SO I THINK SO
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0200704_0201858 NO I THINK I WE DON'T WANNA BE TACKY IF WE'VE GOT A KIND OF DIFFERENT SHAPE ANYWAY UM THE FACT THE M THE MATERIAL THAT WE WOULD BE USING WOULD BE CHEAP
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0201858_0202008 SO WE COULD MAKE IT RED
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202008_0202770 WE COULD MAKE IT UM PSYCHEDELIC YOU KNOW WE COULD MAKE IT BLACK AND WHITE ZEBRA STRIPES
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202770_0203384 BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IS THE M YOU KNOW YES
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0203384_0203662 SO WE COULD JUST PICK ANYTHING
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0205521_0206423 IT'S JUST DIFFERENT IT'S JUST DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING ELSE AND I MEAN I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE UM CLEAN LOOKING HOUSES
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0206423_0207105 SORT OF BEIGE AND BLACK UM SO YOU EITHER WANT SOMETHING THAT GOES WITH THAT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0207105_0207294 WHICH IS WHAT'S ON THE MARKET ANYWAY
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0207294_0208360 OR YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT CONTRASTS AS YOU KNOW LIKE YOU GET CLOCKS NOW THAT ARE MORE OF A TALKING POINT THAN AN ACTUAL CLOCK BECAUSE THEY'RE SO INTERESTING AND
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0209017_0209065 MM
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0209428_0210011 AND YOU WOULD JUST HAVE AN ACROSS THE B YOU WOULD HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT YOU COULD DO

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0211386_0211436 MM
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0211630_0212456 AND ONES THA ONES THAT HAVE RUBBERY SPIKES Y YOU KNOW YOU COULD JUST GO SO FAR WITH IT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0212456_0213177 LIKE A PUFFER FISH YOU COULD JUST YOU COULD TAKE IT WHEREVER SO I THINK THAT'S QUITE A FLEXIBLE THING
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0213669_0213719 YES
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0214542_0214581 MM

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0224476_0225035 UM YOU ASSOCIATE THE NAME WITH THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT THAT IT IS AND THAT DOES THE WORK FOR YOU
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225035_0225419 OBVIOUSLY IT'LL HAVE A LOGO ON IT JUST LIKE EVERYTHING BUT EVERYTHING ELSE HAS A LOGO ON IT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225419_0226057 THE POINT IS THAT IT'S GOT TO STAND OUT SOMEHOW DIFFERENTLY BUT I THINK IT DOES WITHOUT THAT SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0226877_0227640 DEPENDING ON HOW I I MEAN WE'VE GOT THIS MEMO SAYING THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANY'S LOOKING INTO SO
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0227763_0228698 UM THAT SEEMS TO MAKE SENSE BUT IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT'S HUGELY EXPENSIVE WE'D HAVE TO CUT DOWN SOMEWHERE ELSE THEN IT'S WORTH THINKING ABOUT
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0228698_0229151 BUT I THINK WE'LL FIND OUT MORE ABOUT COST AFTERWARDS
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229151_0229325 RIGHT I'M GOING TO WRAP IT UP THERE
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229632_0230258 I GOT A END MEETING NOW MESSAGE ON MY MO YEAH SO

AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0231436_0231523 IT'S EITHER THAT OR
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0231623_0232110 WE ONLY HAD FORTY MINUTES TO DISCUSS WHAT WE JUST DISCUSSED AND DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT TOOK
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232570_0232677 IS EVERYONE HAPPY
AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0232867_0233179 OKAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0009601_0009826 YEAH YEAH I WAS GETTING THAT IMPRESSION AS WELL
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0010985_0011042 ETCETERA
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0017232_0017265 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0017768_0017807 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0036429_0036582 YEAH OKAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0038097_0038352 THAT SCREWED IN
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0038994_0039029 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0040302_0040472 'KAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0041083_0041188 OKAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0041188_0042252 UM THIS IS UH ALL ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE ACTUAL COMPONENTS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPONENTS WE HAVE IN STOCK AT THE MOMENT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042252_0042507 OKAY FIRST UH THE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042623_0042742 INTO THE METHOD
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0042742_0043948 THE THE MAIN IDEA OF THE WHOLE THING IS JUST SO YOU SH YOU JUST PRESS BUTTONS AND IT SHOULD ACTIVATE THINGS ON THE T. V. AND WE DISCUSSED LAST MEETING THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO FIND
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0043948_0044473 UM ALSO IN THIS STUDY I'VE LOOKED INTO THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME OF THE MATERIALS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0044473_0045055 'CAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOKED AT LAST TIME AREN'T UN UNFORTUNATELY AREN'T AVAILABLE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0045266_0045596 UM FINDINGS I'VE GOT MY NICE LITTLE PICTURE THERE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0045596_0046596 THIS IS UH THE CHIP CALLED THE T. A. DOUBLE ONE EIGHT THREE FIVE WHICH IS WHAT'S USED IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY REMOTE CONTROL 'CAUSE IT SENDS OUT STANDARD SIGNALS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0046596_0047486 BASED ON YOUR INPUT AND UM IT'S PRETTY MUCH USED FOR ALL ALL T. V. REMOTES AT THE MOMENT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047486_0047853 UM AND THEN WE WE'RE LOO LOOKING INTO BATTERY OPTIONS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0047986_0048454 THERE'S UM ACTUALLY NO RECHARGEABLE OPTION AVAILABLE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0048454_0049370 SO WE I SAW THE UM THE STANDARD DOUBLE A. AND TRIPLE A. WHICH WE THOUGHT WERE A BIT BIT TOO BULKY AT THE MOMENT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0049370_0050219 DYNAMO CHARGING I THOUGHT THAT THAT MIGHT BE A BIT SILLY TO BE TO BE HONEST PEOPLE WON'T IT'S IT'S BASICALLY LIKE WIND UP RADIO
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0050219_0050626 SO YOU WIND UP YOUR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE YOU USE IT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0050626_0050702 IT MIGHT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0050876_0050947 YOU
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051215_0051688 YEAH YEAH OH YEAH I PRESU YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO WIND IT FOR VERY LONG
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0051688_0052412 BUT I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY SORT OF NECESSARY WHEN YOU TH YOU THINK OF THE NEXT TWO OPTIONS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0052412_0053316 LIKE THE THE SOLAR CHARGING 'CAUSE MOST PEOPLE HAVE THE LIGHT ON IN THE ROOM ANYWAY SO THEY COULD GET WHEN WHEN YOU GOT T. V.
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053519_0053553 NO
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053691_0053742 IS IT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053742_0053910 ALRIGHT I
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055103_0055725 YEAH IT WOULD THE D YEAH THE DYNAMO WOULD TAKE MORE SPACE 'CAUSE YOU ACTUALLY NEED A PHYSICAL SORT OF HANDLE TO WIND UP
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055977_0056085 YEAH OKAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0057173_0057204 BUT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0057514_0058039 YEAH AND MOST PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE ALSO WATCH T. V. IN THE IN THE NIGHT ANYWAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0058725_0059062 BUT I I THINK I THINK THE THE NEXT ONE'S THE BEST ANYWAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059062_0059834 THE THE KINETIC CHARGING WHICH IS LIKE YOU GET IT IN R YOU GET IT IN WRIST WATCHES AND YOU D YOU DON'T EVEN NOTICE IT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059834_0060386 I MEAN THE AMOUNT THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLY MOVING AROUND YOU'D BE DOING ALL THE TIME WOULD WOULD CHARGE IT UP
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0060386_0060805 I DON'T THINK YOU'D EVER NEED TO ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY START SHAKING IT UP TO MAKE IT WORK
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0061351_0062662 UM YEAH IT'S IT CHARGES INTO UM SOME FORM OF IT'S A SMALLER CELL WHICH IT CHARGES INTO AND UH THE SI THE SIZE SORT OF A WATCH A WATCH BATTERY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062662_0062874 'CAUSE THEY USE THEM QUITE FREQUENTLY IN WATCHES
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062874_0064041 AND THAT'LL THAT WOULD L WOULD LAST FOR UM WELL I DO I D I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW LONG IT WOULD LAST BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE RUN OUT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0064511_0064551 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0064990_0065140 YEAH AND
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0065538_0066039 YEAH BUT THEN AGAIN I I THINK IT IS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THE WATCH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0066039_0067333 ALTHOUGH IT'S ONLY A TINY AMOUNT IT'S IT'S UM IT'S ALWAYS MOVING FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND THEY DON'T RUN OUT OVER NIGHT WHEN YOU LEAVE THEM ON THE SIDE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0067333_0067624 AND TH FOR THE SAME THE SAME REASON
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0067624_0068678 YOU'RE ONLY USING IT FOR A V INCREDIBLY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME JUST TO SEND THE SIGNAL AND THEN YOU'RE FINISHED WITH IT AND YOU PUT IT NO NO I DO I DON'T THINK THE THE DRAW ON IT WOULD BE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0068853_0068905 MM
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0069582_0070774 YE YEAH I THINK I TH UH G Y YOU COULD HAVE A DUAL UM POWER THING BUT THE THE THING WITH THE SOLAR CELLS IS YOU WOULD NEED TO PUT THEM ON THE CASE AND THEY BECAUSE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0070774_0071499 IF YOU LIE ON A CALCULATOR THEY THEY'RE QUI THEY'RE QUITE BIG AND THEY ALL THEY ALL LOOK I IDENTICAL
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0071725_0071915 THEY'RE THEY'RE EXPENSIVE THEY DON'T
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0072299_0073132 YEAH THE NORMAL BATTERIES WOULD BE THE CHEAPEST I'D PRESUME THEN IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE THE THE SOLAR CHARGING ONES UM BUT THE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0073243_0073799 IT'S I I THINK THEY'RE NOT VERY RESISTANT TO DROPPING
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0073799_0074827 'CAUSE IF YOU DROP STUFF YEAH IF YOU IF YOU HAVE Y THE SIZE YOU'D NEED TO CHARGE A REMOTE WOULDN'T BE THAT BIG BUT I MEAN IF REMOTES ALWAYS GET THROWN AROUND AND STUFF
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0074827_0074850 SO
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0074990_0075189 Y I THINK YEAH PRACTICALLY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0075365_0076057 I MEAN CALCULATORS YOU DON'T REALLY THROW AROUND A LOT WHEREAS REMOTES YOU DO THEY CAN T
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0076239_0076697 YEAH THEY DO THEY YEAH THEY'VE GOT DUAL THINGS BUT THEY'RE THE BATTERIES ARE SMALLER I THINK
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077497_0077618 MM
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077618_0077833 W M YEAH SO THE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0077962_0078479 YEAH THE THE S IF YOU IF YOU HAD SOMETHING DU UH USING THE STANDARD
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078600_0078967 BATTERIES AND THE SOLAR CHARGING UM
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0078967_0079783 I DON'T THINK YOU'D I THINK THE IT WOULD D WELL YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE STANDARD DOUBLE A. S WOULD LAST IN OR TRIPLE A. S WOULD LAST
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0079932_0080195 YEAH I THINK I I THINK IT WOULD YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0081175_0081225 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0083263_0083301 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0084723_0084763 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0084984_0085014 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0086804_0086850 OKAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0087220_0087329 OKAY WELL I'LL MOVE ON
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0087485_0088899 UM MY SECOND PART OF MY FINDINGS UH THE MO MOST CURRENT REMOTES USE THIS SILICONE UH P. C. B. BOARD WHICH PR PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0088899_0089550 WHICH BASICALLY HAS THESE CONTACTS THAT ARE REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEN WHEN YOU PRESS DOWN ON THE RUBBER BUTTON
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0089550_0091768 IT'LL CONNECT THE CIRCUIT AND EACH EACH SWITCH IS CONNECTED TO TWO UH DIFFERENT LEGS ON THE CHIP AND SO SENDS A DIFFERENT MESSAGE AND THAT THEN UH GETS TRANSLATED BY THE CHIP INTO A CODE AND THEN IT'S FIRED OUT OF THIS L. E. D. IN THE SEQUENCE OF L ON AND OFF BURSTS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0092527_0092560 WELL
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0092714_0093013 WELL THIS THE THI THE THING ABOUT IS UM
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0093157_0094354 THEY THEY CAN BE AS BIG OR AS SMALL AS YOU WANT THEM TO BE BECAUSE YOU CAN YOU CAN PRINT CIRCUIT BOARD LIKE THAT THAT IT'S IT'S SIMPLY SPACED LIKE THAT SO YOU CAN HAVE FIT THE N THE SIZE OF THE NINE BUTTONS IN
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094354_0094603 IF YOU IF YOU SEE HOW THIN THE TRACKS ARE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094603_0095211 YOU COULD YOU COULD S YOU COULD PUT THEM VIRTUALLY RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MUCH SMALLER SWITCH ON EACH ONE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0095211_0096216 IF YOU IF YOU WANTED TO BUT UM THE THERE IS AN OPTION TO DO TO DO IT LIKE THAT OR YOU COULD HAVE SOME SORT OF
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096359_0096753 ARRAY OF SWITCHES WHICH I'LL SPEAK ABOUT IN THE NEXT BIT SO THAT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096908_0097666 AND THEN TO UH YEAH SO TO CONSERVE BATTERY LIFE THE REMOTE SHOULD BE IN A STANDBY MODE NO WHILE NOT BEING USED
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0097666_0098463 NOW WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT WAS 'CAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN Y WHEN YOU HAVE THESE THINGS THEY'VE GOT LITTLE LIGHTS ON BEHIND THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0098463_0099218 SO YOU CAN SEE WHAT ALL THE BUTTONS ARE LIKE ON A MOBILE PHONE THEY DO IT MORE OFTEN THAN ON A THAN ON A T. V. REMOTE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099218_0099999 BUT YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE LIGHTS BEHIND THE BUTTONS AND UM AFTER LIKE FIVE OR TEN SECONDS OF NOT BEING USED I'D HAVE THAT TURNED OFF
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099999_0100304 IF WE DECIDED TO GO FOR BUTTONS THAT COULD LIGHT UP
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0100491_0101417 UM THE CASE MATERIAL I'VE A BEEN SENT WHAT THE FACTORY CAN ACTUALLY GIVE US
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0101417_0102327 THE THERE'S THE PLASTIC WHICH I THINK WE WERE GONNA GO FOR ANYWAY AS THE MAIN CASE CASE HOUSING AND
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0102459_0103250 THE THE MAIN PROBLEMS WITH THE WELL YOU COULD GO FOR WOOD BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A BIT IMPRACTICAL
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0103250_0104324 TITANIUM UM VERY EXPENSIVE JUST TO PROCESS WHICH TO MAKE IT IS EXPENSIVE AND RUBBER
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0104324_0105188 WELL YOU'RE SAYING THAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS UH SPONGY FEEL THIS YEAR SO PERHAPS UH SOME SOMETHING MADE OF RUBBER
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105188_0105650 BUT I WAS THINKING MORE OF THE BUTTONS BECAUSE THE BUTTONS WHICH THEY'VE THEY'VE SAID
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105785_0106024 THAT THEY'VE THEY'VE PUT ACROSS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106153_0106991 ARE WHAT IS USED IN SOME STRESS BALL MANUFACTURE AND IT'S MEANT TO BE ANTI R. S. I.
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106991_0107867 I'M NO I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT WOULD WORK BECAUSE SURELY YOUR FINGERS WOULD STILL BE MOVING OVER THE SHORT DISTANCES BUT THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0107867_0108482 UM THE PROBLEM WITH THE CASING IS THAT UH THERE'S
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0108608_0109417 QUITE UM THERE'S QUITE A FEW DESIGN RESTRICTIONS THAT THEY'VE GOT ON THE SHAPE OF THE CASE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109417_0109818 IF YOU GO FOR TITANIUM THEY CAN ONLY DO A STANDARD BOX SHAPE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109818_0110496 WHEREAS IF YOU COME TO PLASTIC THEY CAN THEY CAN BE A LITTLE MORE THEY CAN THEY CAN DO SORT OF CURVED SHAPES
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0110496_0110920 BUT WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT BECAUSE WE'D HAVE IT IN TWO SEPARATE UNITS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0111136_0111242 FOR THE FLIP PHONE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0111601_0111639 YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0112321_0112383 YEAH I TH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0112680_0112708 UH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0112823_0113240 YEAH IN IN TITANIUM I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE AT ALL REALLY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113240_0113765 THE JU JUST IT W WELL YOU COULD MAKE IT AVAILABLE IN THE TITANIUM
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113765_0114170 IT WAS JUST IT WOULD BE SO EXPENSIVE TO BUY A NEW CASE FOR IT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0114170_0115100 BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF HOW MUCH TITANIUM IS IS IT'S LIGHT AND STRONG BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE LEFT FOR AIRCRAFT DESIGN RATHER THAN FOR
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0115243_0115311 FOR A REMOTE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0115672_0115851 YEAH YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116388_0116511 RUBBER YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0116863_0117008 AND YOU CAN PEEL THEM OFF YEAH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0117603_0117674 YEAH

AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0119373_0120482 ALSO THE JUST JUST GOING BACK TO THE INTERFACE DESIGNS WITH THE BUTTONS THE I KNO WE WERE PLANNING TO DO SOME SORT OF TOUCH SCREEN
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0120482_0121957 NOW WHAT I WAS SAYING BEFORE ABOUT INSTEAD OF HAVING YOU COULD HAVE JUST A BARE P. C. B. CIRCUIT BOARD AND I'M SURE YOU COULD PROBABLY GET IT IN DIFFERENT COLOURS AND SO JUST BY TOUCHING IT WITH YOUR FINGER IT'D MAKE THE CONNECTION
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122071_0122465 OVER IF YOU HAD THEM CLOSE ENOUGH THAT WOULD BE ONE OPTION
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122465_0122835 UM THE SECOND OPTION TH THEY OFFER RUBBER BUTTONS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122835_0123831 BUT I THOUGHT THAT AN L. C. D. TYPE OF SCREEN 'CAUSE ONE THEY'RE INCREDIBLY THIN UM AND DON'T TAKE UP MUCH SPACE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0123831_0124958 TWO THEY YOU CAN HAVE THEM IN A SORT OF ARRAY AND YOU CAN ARRANGE THE BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN IN A SORT OF SET THING AND YOU COULD HAVE THEM LIKE A TOUCH
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125092_0125155 DISPLAY
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125432_0125558 UH WHAT WHAT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0125910_0127015 OH ON THE ON THE L. C. D. SCREEN YOU COULD BECAU YOU COULD FIT IT THE PROBLEM WITH IT BASICALLY IS THAT IT'S FLAT AND SO YOU CAN'T DO LOTS OF CURVE CURVED THINGS WITH IT
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127015_0127827 BUT UM YOU CAN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WITH THE L. C. D. YOU'D HAVE THE WIRES COMING OFF YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THAT WITH THE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0127940_0128210 WITH THE L. C. D. YOU'D ONLY HAVE THAT WITH THE PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0128320_0128392 WITH

AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129264_0129906 YOU COULD HAVE A FLAT SCREEN INSIDE YEAH BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHETHER WE WANT AN L. C. D. SCREEN INSIDE
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0129906_0130571 IT WOULDN'T BE LIKE FULL COLOUR IT WOULD JUST BE BLACK AND WHITE BUT THERE'D BE TOUCH TOUCH BUTTONS
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0130571_0131188 SO YOU WOULDN'T BE PRESSING DOWN ON 'EM W OR WE COULD HAVE RUBBER BUTTONS WHICH ARE MADE OF THIS MATERIAL WHICH IS ANTI R. S. I.
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0131618_0131678 IS RUBBER
AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0132141_0132189 MM

AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025119_0025656 UM WE DECIDED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT I UH REQUIRED IN A REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE AND WE'LL COME TO THAT LATER
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025656_0025849 SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025849_0026370 ALSO WITH OUR COMPANY UM BEING FORERUNNERS IN UH PUTTING FASHION INTO TECHNOLOGY
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0026370_0026908 WE ALSO LOOKED AT A FASHION UPDATE UM USING OUR CONSULTANTS ON FASHION AND DESIGN IN PARIS AND MILAN
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0027029_0028144 UH SO THE GENERAL FINDINGS FROM THAT WAS UH IN THE MARKET TRENDS THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS WERE PEOPLE WANT A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028144_0028599 RATHER THAN THE THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL OF REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0028599_0028955 THEY ALSO ALSO WANT A REMOTE CONTROL TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029089_0029420 AND OF COURSE AS WE PREDICTED THAT IT SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029420_0029974 NOW I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THE FIRST OF THOSE FINDINGS FANCY LOOK AND FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029974_0030639 IS TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS THE SECOND TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE WHICH IS IN TURN TWICE AS IMPORTANT AS BEING EASY TO USE
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0030783_0031218 SO POSSIBLY THAT THE FEATURE THAT WE PUT FIRST IS ACTUALLY THIRD IS STILL IMPORTANT
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031218_0031695 BUT IT'S THIRD IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE FOR THE THE SUBJECT GROUP WE LOOKED AT
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031695_0032413 OKAY UM NOW THE FASHION UPDATE WHICH RELATES TO VERY PERSONAL PREFERENCES AMONG OUR SUBJECT GROUP
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0032413_0033086 UM WE FOUND FROM OUR UM CONSULTANTS IN PARIS AND MILAN WHO DES ATTENDED ALL THE DESIGN AND FASHION FAIRS THERE
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033086_0033505 THAT FRUIT AND VEGETABLES ARE GOING TO BE THE THEME FOR CLOTHES SHOES AND FURNITURE
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033505_0033912 SO SHOULD WE BE THINKING OF USING SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN OUR REMOTE CONTROL DESIGN TOO
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034013_0034785 THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE UM A TREND TOWARDS A SPONGY FEEL TO MATERIALS UH AGAIN IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034785_0035432 SO A LOT OF INTERESTING FEEDBACK THERE BOTH FROM OUR MARKET RESEARCH DEPARTMENTS AND FROM OUR PEOPLE IN PARIS AND MILAN
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0035432_0035654 BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT OUR DESIGN PEOPLE MAKE OF THAT
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036543_0036742 UNLESS ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT
AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0036742_0036901 NOT YET

AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0069148_0069726 COULD PEOPLE PUT STANDARD BATTERIES IN BUT WITH A S YOU KNOW THEY COULD LEAVE IT IN THE SUNLIGHT FOR SOLAR CHARGING OR THE TWO THINGS NOT COMPATIBLE

AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158314_0158496 THERE ARE A FEW BUT IN GENERAL NOT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158673_0159520 NOW TALKING ABOUT THE TARGET GROUP WHICH IS IN A SENSE EVERYBODY BUT I THINK WITHIN THE TARGET GROUP WE HAVE SUBGROUPS
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0159520_0160519 WE HAVE WE HAVE EARLIER IT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT UM FOR EXAMPLE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIMITED FUNCTION WITH THEIR FINGERS AND HANDS
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160519_0160975 SO I THINK THAT'S UH ONE GROUP THAT'S CERTAINLY IMPORTANT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160975_0161845 UM THEN WE HAVE JUST THE NERVOUS PEOPLE WHO CAN NEVER PRESS A LITTLE BUTTON ON ANYTHING UM UNLESS IT'S REALLY VERY CLEAR
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0161845_0162455 AND UH I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE WANT TO CATER TO CHILDREN'S USE
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0162455_0163223 I MEAN THAT'S A QUESTION UM WHETHER THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT CHILDREN CAN REALLY USE IT OR NOT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163447_0163714 SO THIS THESE ARE JUST SOME THOUGHTS I HAVE ON IT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163714_0165367 AND UM I DUNNO WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN JUST SAY WE HAVE ONE TARGET GROUP AND FOR THIS ONE TARGET GROUP WE'RE GONNA DESIGN THIS ONE THING OR WHETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT WE LIKE WE WE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT SHAPES
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0165367_0166225 WHETHER THAT DIFFERENT SHAPE ALSO INCLUDES MAYBE DIFFERENT UH BUTTONS UH FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0166688_0166727 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0167876_0168847 THAT HAS A LOT OF THAT HAS A LOT OF APPEAL BUT I THINK UH I'M I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY NOW ON IT WHETHER WE'RE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT GROUPS
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0168847_0169322 I THINK THE CHILDREN ISSUE CAN BE ADDRESSED WITH THE SHAPE AND WITH COLOURS
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0169322_0170178 YOU KNOW LIKE YOU MAKE IT NICE AND PINK FLUORESCENT BANANA COLOUR OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW YEAH FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170178_0170467 BUT THE QUESTION IS REALLY WHO IS OUR TARGET GROUP
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170623_0170867 DO WE LOOK AT ONE TARGET GROUP
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170984_0172090 AND WITH THE TWENTY FIVE EUROS YOU KNOW CAN WE CAN WE AFFORD TO HAVE UH I'M ASKING THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE HERE WHETHER UM TO LOOK AT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0172297_0172966 SORT OF SUBGROUPS WITH MAYBE DIFFERENT BUTTONS FOR EACH GROUP HOW MUCH WOULD THAT THROW US
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0173074_0173490 OUT OF THE COST WE ARE SUPPOSED TO RESPECT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0174714_0174751 RIGHT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0175538_0175628 WITH WITH
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0175729_0175765 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0176298_0176399 WELL THAT'S THAT'S
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179156_0179208 YEAH
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179414_0179502 NO
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179785_0180380 THE THE QUEST THE QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED HERE IS ONLY WHO IS THE TARGET GROUP AND HOW WILL IT FUNCTION
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0180380_0181272 AND I THINK THE HOW WILL IT FUNCTION IS PROBABLY THE QUESTION OF THE BUTTONS YOU KNOW WITHIN THE TARGET GROUP OR SUBGROUPS
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0181272_0182218 THE QUESTION IS ONLY WHETHER OUR BUDGET WILL ALLOW TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE DESIGN IN A SENSE
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182218_0182431 I MEAN THE BASIC DESIGN I UNDERSTAND WILL BE THE SAME
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182431_0183428 BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH WILL THAT SET US BACK IF LET'S SAY UH FORTY PERCENT WE MAKE LARGE BUTTONS AND THE REST WE MAKE REGULAR BUTTONS FOR EXAMPLE
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0183533_0184353 SO THAT REMAINS TO S TO BE SEEN BUT UH THE TARGET GROUP AS A WHOLE IS IS BASICALLY EVERYBODY WITH A T. V.
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0185553_0185747 YEAH WELL THAT'S THAT'S THE QUESTION
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0186847_0187426 WELL MAYBE THERE'S THERE'S AN IDEA YOU KNOW T THE NEW FOR EXAMPLE NEW PORTABLE PHONES
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187426_0187816 THEY HAVE LIKE REMOVABLE PLASTIC CASES
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187816_0188477 SO YOU CAN HAVE A STRIPED ONE OR YOU CAN HAVE A FLUORESCENT BLUE ONE OR WHATEVER AND MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0188477_0190040 THAT IN EACH PACKAGE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU YOU HAVE YOU HAVE FOR EXAMPLE UH YOU HAVE LET'S SAY A FLUORESCENT BLUE ON IT BUT THEN YOU HAVE UH ANOTHER COLOUR OR STRIPE WHATEVER THAT ALREADY COMES IN A PACKAGE
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190040_0190371 AND THEN IF PEOPLE REALLY WANT MORE COLOURS THEY CAN BUY IT SEPARATELY
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190507_0190650 YOU KNOW YES
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190927_0190982 THAT'S RIGHT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0190982_0191694 AND BUT LIKE IF IF THEN EVERYBODY IS IS IS TIRED OF THE FLUORESCENT BLUE AND OF THE STRIPED OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE AS ANOTHER ONE IN THE PACKAGE
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0191694_0192696 THEN THEY CAN GO TO THE STORE AND FOR A FEW UH FRANCS OR EUROS WHATEVER THEY CAN BUY AN ALTERNATE PACKAGE WITH ANOTHER TWO COLOURS IN IT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0194549_0196111 WELL I THINK I THINK THE IDEA HERE IS TO UH TO TO D DESIGN ONE REMOTE AND WHAT THE ONLY CHANGE IS GONNA BE UM THE FUNCT D T YEAH UH THE FUNCTIONAL FUNCTIONAL COSMETICS IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT WAY
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0196111_0197066 UM HAVING MAYBE LARGER BUTTONS OR BUTTONS THAT LIGHT UP OR BUTTONS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY SHAPED FOR PEOPLE UH EITHER FOR CHILDREN UM
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0197287_0197556 FIVE MINUTES THAT WAS I GUESS THA THAT'S THE OLD MESSAGE

AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0198892_0199452 BUT I THINK I I THINK TO SUM IT UP THE TARGET GROUP IS BASICALLY EVERYBODY
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0199452_0200023 IF MONEY PERMITS WE CAN ADDRESS SOME FEATURES FOR SOME SUBGROUPS WITHIN THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200145_0200247 DO WE AGREE DO WE
AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0200474_0201028 DO WE AGREE ON ON THAT IN PRINCIPLE LIKE MONEY WILL TELL WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT OR NOT

AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0121442_0122422 AS UH USER INTERFACE DESIGNER I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE THE FEATURES WHICH A USER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ON THEIR REMOTE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0122422_0122697 YEAH CAN YOU PLEASE GO ONTO THE NEXT SLIDE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0122697_0123822 SO I FOUND OUT THAT UH BUT UH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF A REMOTE IS TO UH F CONTROL THE FUNCTION OF A TELEVISION AT A FAR OFF DISTANCE AT REMOTE DISTANCE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0123988_0124081 NOW FOR THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0124081_0125332 UH A REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD HAVE A SWITCH ON OFF BUTTON BY WHICH A USER CAN SIT ANYWHERE IN THE ROOM IN FRONT OF THE T. V. AND HE CAN CONTROL THE FUNCTIONALITIES DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE T. V.
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0125332_0126793 THERE SHOULD BE A SIGNAL UH SOMETHING LIKE A RADIO WAVE OR A INFRARED LIGHT OR A LED WHICH CAN BE USED TO CHANGE THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES IN THE TELEVISION IF THE USER WANTS TO UH CHANGE THE CHANNELS OR INCREASE THE VOLUME HE CAN CHANGE IT
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0126978_0127965 NOW THERE SHOULD BE SOME TIMER TO SET FOR VIEWING A PARTICULAR A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME OR SWITCHING ON AND OFF A UH A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME ACCORDING TO THE USER CHOICE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128074_0128151 YES
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128151_0128195 YES
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128388_0128951 SO IF IF HE WANT TO VIEW A PARTICULAR PROGRAMME AT SAY NINE O'CLOCK HE CAN SET THE TIME
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0128951_0129389 AND THE T. V. WILL AUTOMATICALLY IT WILL SWITCH ON AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0129389_0130658 SO HE CAN USE THAT KIND OF UH UH PROPERTIES OF FEATURES AND THEN THERE SHOULD BE A CHILD LOCK SYSTEM IF A PARTICULAR CHANNEL IS NOT TO BE VIEWED BY A PARTICULAR UH FOR A CERTAIN AGE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0130658_0131316 THEN THE PARENTS CAN LOCK THAT PARTICULAR CHANNEL SO THAT THE CH CHILDREN CANNOT VIEW THAT CHANNEL
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0131316_0132153 AND UH THE UH THE UH AND THE ONE OF THE FEATURE A USER WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IS THE COMPACTNESS OF THE CO REMOTE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0132383_0133347 UH T THE REMOTE SHOULD BE COMPACT AND IT SHOULD HA IT SHOULD HAVE AS MANY BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE FOR CONTROLLING DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE T. V. TELEVISION
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0133347_0134209 AND UM UH AS UH UH THIS IS MY PERSONAL PREFERENCE THAT IT SHOULD BE IN THE SHAPE OF A T. IN ALPHABET FOR MORE COMPACTABILITY
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0134353_0134816 AND UH AND UH AND IT IS ONE MORE POINT WHICH I NOTED IT DOWN
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0134816_0135989 LIKE UH THE MATERIAL WHICH WHICH WHICH IS USED FOR REMOTES SHOULD BE HUMAN FRIENDLY IT SHOULD NOT CAUSE ANY SKIN DISEASE OR SOMETHING SOME AL ALLERGY TO EITHER CHILDREN OR TO UM AD ADULT PERSON
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0135989_0137124 AND IT SHOULD HAVE AN UH IT CAN HAVE AN ALARM CLOCK A A PERSON IF SOME IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET UP AT AROUND EIGHT EIGHT P. M. THEN HE CAN SET THE TIME AND IT CAN BE USED AS AN ALARM CLOCK
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137124_0137523 AND I DON'T THINK IT WILL COST MUCH TO SET AN ALARM CLOCK INSIDE A REMOTE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0137830_0138232 YES AND AS JOHN REECE SAID THE BUTTONS CAN BE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0138232_0139184 UH CAN ME WE CAN USE THE FLUORESCENCE TO LIGHT UP THE BUTTONS SO DIFFERENT UH BUTTONS WILL GLOW DIFFERENTLY
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139184_0139773 SO IN EVEN IN THE DARK THE USER CAN KNOW WHAT BUTTONS TO USE TO SWITCH ON A PARTICULAR CHANNEL
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0139914_0140886 AND UH UH THE DESIGN OF THE UH UM REMOTE SHOULD BE IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY SHARP PROJECTIONS SO THAT IF A CHILD PLAYS WITH A REMOTE
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0140886_0141138 HE UH HE SHOULD NOT BE HARMED IN ANY WAY
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0141528_0142412 AND FINDINGS UH I FOUND OUT UH Y UM ON DIFFERENT SITES THAT UH THERE ARE DIFFERENT REMOTES WHICH CAN BE USED
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0142412_0143443 THERE ARE REMOTES WHICH USE THE INFRARED FOR CONTROLLING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES THERE ARE REMOTES WHICH USE THE RADIO WAVES TO CONTROL THE FUNCTIONS AND THERE ARE UH
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0143608_0144513 SO UH THERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT UH TYPES OF REMOTES FOR DIFFERENT LIGHT SOURCE WHICH ARE USED WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CONTROLLING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES OF A TELEVISION

AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0146201_0147193 UH NO UH LIKE IT CAN IT CAN BE USED AS A T. V. CONTROL AS PLUS AN ALARM CLOCK TO SET AN ALARM A TIMING AND IT SHOULD HAVE A CHILD LOCK
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147193_0147988 AND THEN TO SAVE ELECTRICITY UH THERE SHOULD NOT BE UH MUCH S MOVE UH LOTS OF CIRCUITS AND ALL THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0147988_0148961 AND IF A PERSON IF IF IF PARENTS WANTS THE TELEVISION TO BE SWITCHED OFF BY TEN O'CLOCK THEN IT SHOULD BE SWITCHED OFF TEN O AT TEN O'CLOCK AUTOMATICALLY

AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060771_0060994 YEAH EXACTLY
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0060994_0061373 UH SO TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061373_0061644 UM CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLI SLIDE PLEASE
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061832_0062592 THE METAL IS LIKE UH IN A REMOTE CONTROLLER YOU HAVE A CHIP INTEGRATED CIRCUIT WHICH IS LIKE A BRAIN OF THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0062592_0063941 IT TAKES THE POWER FROM A BATTERY SAY A BATTERY IT IT CAN BE A ELEC AN ELECTRIC SUPPLY LIKE YOU HAVE TO UH LIKE UH SWITCH CONNEC CONNECT CONNECT YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER TO UH POWER SUPPLY FROM THE YOU KNOW ELECTRICITY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0063941_0066293 IT SHOULD BE A BATTERY BECAUSE UH UH REMOTE CONTROLLER SHOULD BE LIKE YOU YOU YOU SHOULD TAKE IT T TO WHEREVER YOU WANT AND THEN UM UH TH THIS INTEGRATED CIRCUITRY TAKES ENERGY FROM THE POWER SOURCE AND WHATEVER LIKE IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON IT'S LIKE A INPUT FOR THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND IT TAKES THE INPUT AND IT IT TRANSFORMS INTO A INFRO INFRARED BITS AND IT SENDS IT INTO THE DEVICE
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066293_0066601 LIKE A T. V. OR A AIR CONDITIONER SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066643_0067027 UH A REMOTE CONTROLLER IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO A SINGLE DEVICE
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0067027_0068629 IF YOU WANT TO DESIGN IT FOR MULTIPLE DEVICES THEN YOU SHOULD MAKE ALL THE DEVICES COMPATIBLE WITH THE FREQUENCY LIKE UH TH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER IT SENDS SOME BITS SOME UH WAVES LIKE WITH A PARTICULAR FREQUENCY THE DEVICE SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE FREQUENCY IS
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0068629_0070147 IT SHOULD RE RE RECOGNISE THE UH WAVES WHICH ARE COMING FROM THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND IT SHOULD TAKE THE ACTION LIKE IF YOU PRESS A BUTTON CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEN UH THE REMOTE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER WILL SEND A SEND A SE SEND A SIGNAL
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070147_0070757 AND THE T. V. IT SHOULD TRANSLATE THAT INTO LIKE CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070757_0071600 CHANGE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND UH SO UH I THINK IT'S HARD TO DESIGN A REMOTE CONTROLLER FOR MULTIPLE UH DEVICES
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0071851_0071905 UH YEAH
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0072352_0072403 UM
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0072628_0073653 SO UH USER INTERFACE CONTROLS THE CHIP AND ACCORDINGLY THE MESSAGES LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A USER USER IN INTERFACE LIKE YOU KNOW SWITCH PAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUTTONS SHOULD BE THERE
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0073653_0073867 SO UH YOU CAN CONTROL WHATEVER YOU WANT
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0073867_0076040 YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL YOU WANT TO CONTROL THE VOLUME YOU YOU WANT TO UH MUTE UH MUTE THE UH T. V. OR YOU WANT TO HAVE A CHILD LOCK OR YOU WANT TO DO SOME OPERATIONS THERE'S A THERE SHOULD BE SOME DEVICE TO TELL WHAT TO DO TO THE UH IN UH INTEGRATED CIRCUIT SO THAT THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT CAN S SEND THE SIGNALS AND T. V. CAN PERFORM THE ACTIONS
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0076111_0076315 SO CAN YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0076382_0077721 SO I I JUST WOULD LIKE TO UH ADD SOME EXTRA FEATURES TO THE REMOTE CONTROLLER UM I THINK THESE ARE THE VERY SIMPLE FEATURES AND UH THEY DON'T TAKE MUCH UH UH MUCH OF THE UM UM INVESTMENT ALSO
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0077721_0079412 IT'S LIKE EL THE TEXT OR BUTTONS WHICH UH WHICH ARE THERE ON THE UH REMOTE CONTROLLER THEY THOSE WE CAN MAKE UH UM LIKE FLUORESCENT UH THEY'LL BE LIKE LIGHT EMITTING IF IT IS DARK SO THAT YOU CAN FIND YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER IF IT IS DARK
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0079506_0081211 AND THER THERE SHOULD BE A BEEP IF MANY BUTTONS ARE PRESSED IF SUPPOSE A CHILD IS PLAYING WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLER AND A AND SHE SHE OR HE IS PRESSING THE BUTTONS ALL AT THE TIME THEN THERE SHOULD BE A BEEP SAYING THAT IT'S THIS THIS IS NOT A A YOU KNOW A A ACTION
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081211_0081515 THERE CAN BE NO ACTION TAKING TO THAT SO
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081515_0081690 AND THERE SHOULD BE A CHILD LOCK
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081690_0083182 LIKE UH UH YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCK YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER SO THAT UH UM WHATEVER BUTTONS ARE PRESSED BY A CHILD THEY CAN'T BE LIKE Y YOU I YOU IF YOU HAVE KI KIDS AND ALL THEN THEY'LL BE PL PLAYING WITH THE REMOTE CONTROLLERS SO CAN LOCK THE REMOTE CONTROLLER
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0083182_0084080 IF MAKE IT USEABLE FOR MORE THAN ONE DEVICE IT'S A IT'S HARD BUT I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT UH YEAH YEAH YEAH SO IT'S IT'S OKAY

AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090440_0091106 AND AND THE BUTTO BUTTONS ALSO I THINK IF YOU WANT TO HAVE MORE FEATURES IN YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER THEN THERE SHOULD BE MORE BUTTONS
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091106_0091392 IF THERE ARE MORE BUTTONS THEN IT WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091392_0091748 IF YOU HAVE LESS FEATURES THEN YOUR REMOTE CONTROLLER WON'T BE ATTRACTIVE
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091748_0092561 SO I THINK UH WE NEED TO MAKE SOME BUTTONS WHICH ARE WHICH ARE LIKE UM UH F IN UH IN INTENDED FOR TWO OR THREE OPERATIONS
AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0092561_0093299 LIKE IF YOU PRESS ONE BUTTON IN ONE MODE THEN IT WILL CHANGE THE CHANNEL IF YOU PRESS THE OTHER BUTTON IN ANOTHER MODE IT WILL CHANGE THE COLOUR

AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010847_0010963 THERE WE GO
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0010963_0011958 OKAY WELL I THINK WE HAVE INTRODUCED OURSELVES SO THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE IS IS PART OF MY GOAL BUT WHY DON'T WE PASS RIGHT TO THE SECOND SLIDE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012069_0012334 CAUSE THAT'S WHERE M MY DISCUSSION STARTS
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012334_0013030 RIGHT WELL UM SINCE I'M IN CHARGE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE SHOULD PUT ON THIS THING SINCE I HAVE TO TRY TO SELL IT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0013030_0013619 UM I THOUGHT THAT THE METHOD I SHOULD FOLLOW WOULD BE GATHER SUGGESTIONS FROM EVERYBODY
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0013619_0014672 AND TH THE REASON I JUST PUT THAT THERE LIKE THAT IS THAT UH IN THE INIT IN THE INITIAL STAGE I THINK I SHOULD JUST BE OPEN TO LOTS OF SUGGESTIONS
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0014672_0015069 YOU KNOW YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT NO MATTER HOW SILLY IT SOUNDS YOU KNOW IT SHOULD RUN YOUR CAR
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0015069_0016531 IT SHOULD HEAT UP YOUR MOTOR IF SHOULD UM TURN ON YOUR C. D. WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO DO UM AND THEN AS WE GO ON WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IS ACCEPT AND ELIMINATE THESE SUGGESTIONS ACCORDING TO UM DESIGN AND BUDGET FEASIBILITY
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0016562_0017633 SO I'LL BE COMING TO YOU UM FREQUENTLY AS THE INDUSTRIAL EXPERT TO TELL ME HOW HARD IT'S GONNA BE TO ADD A FEATURE OR HOW EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE OR IF YOUR TIME
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0017633_0018011 IF IT TAKES FIVE YEARS TO DEVELOP THIS IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE CAN'T DO
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018011_0018921 SO IN THE BEGINNING JUST HAVE A BIG PUDDLE OF THINGS THAT WE ANYBODY CAN TH THROW ANYTHING IN AND THEN JUST WEED THINGS OUT THAT CAN'T BE DONE FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018921_0019778 AND THEN THE THINGS THAT SEEM THE MOST ATTRACTIVE THAT TO UH TO A CUSTOMER WE'LL TRY TO THEN PRIORITISE THOSE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0019778_0020047 SO THAT WAS UM WHAT I MEANT THERE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020047_0020887 AND AS I SAID ON THE SLIDE THERE CONSULTING THE INDUSTRIAL ENGINEER ABOUT THAT AND THE OTHER THING IS TIMING IS REALLY GONNA BE AS IMPORTANT AS MONEY
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020887_0021322 BECAUSE IF WE'RE GONNA SELL THIS THING I THINK THE BEST TIME TO SELL IT IS AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021364_0021801 TWENTY FIVE EUROS MAKES A NICE LITTLE PRESENT AND WE WANT IT TO BE AN IMPULSE PURCHASE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021801_0022222 WE WANT SOMEBODY TO SEE IT AND THINK IT'S GEE I JUST GOTTA HAVE THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022222_0022406 AND TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET AND BUY IT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022406_0022828 SO IT'S GOTTA BE REALLY ATTRACTIVE AND IT BUT IT'S GOTTA GO TO MARKET BY SEPTEMBER
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022828_0023485 'CAUSE ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE OUT THERE IN SEPTEMBER SHOWING IT AROUND ISN'T GONNA SELL FOR CHRISTMAS
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0023485_0026102 UM AND THEN I'LL BE COMING TO YOU AS THE USER INTERFACE PERSON TO TRY TO TELL ME FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW WHAT ARE THE MOST FRIENDLY FEATURES THAT WE COULD PUT ON IT AND TRY TO PRIOR HELP ME WITH THAT PRIORITISING OF UH OF THE FEATURES AND OF THE THE LOOK AND THE COLOUR AND I'LL BE COMING BACK TO YOU TO HELP WEED OUT THOSE SUGGESTIONS FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026131_0026563 SO I'LL BE COMING TO YOU FOR HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA COST US AND HOW LONG IS IT GONNA TAKE YOU
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0026563_0027101 AND I'LL BE COMING TO YOU TO TELL ME WHAT'S GONNA MAKE SOMEBODY TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET YOU KNOW
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0027101_0027851 WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S GONNA REALLY BE WHAT THEY CALL A SIZZLE 'CAUSE WE GOTTA SELL THIS SIZZLE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0027851_0029054 A LOT OF TIMES THE THING THAT WORKS THE BEST FROM AN ENGINEERING POINT OF VIEW ISN'T THE THING THAT SOMEBODY'S REALLY JUST GONNA TAKE OUT THEIR WALLET AND BUY FOR CHRISTMAS FOR FOR THEIR CHILD OR FOR THEIR HUSBAND OR WHATEVER
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0029054_0029206 OKAY CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0029486_0030625 ALRIGHT I I ALREADY DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH AFTER OUR FIRST MEETING WHERE WE THREW OUT SOME IDEAS AND IT LOOKS TO ME THAT WITHIN THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE UH THE WHOLE HOUSE IDEA REALLY ISN'T GONNA BE POSSIBLE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0030625_0031175 SO I'D LIKE YOUR SUGGESTIONS TO COME BACK TO THE OTHER SLIDE WHERE I WAS SAYING WE WE COULD SUGGEST ANYTHING
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031175_0031708 I'D LIKE THE SUGGESTIONS TO BE REALLY SPECIFIC SO THAT WE'LL HAVE A LIST OF THINGS WE CAN CROSS OFF
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031708_0032924 NOT SOMETHING LIKE YOU KNOW WHOLE HOUSE CONTROL WHAT'LL BE AND THEN I FOUND ON THE INTERNET FROM FROM MY RESEARCH THAT SOME EXTENDED ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT CONTROL SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0032924_0033501 AT THE BUDGET THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND AT THE PRICE POINT WE'RE LOOKING AT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK THE T. V. THE V. C. R.
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0033501_0034381 THE STEREO SET UM MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE CUTE LIKE A COFFEE POT OR ONE OTHER APPLIANCE OR MAYBE A LAMP
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0034381_0034459 I HAVE TO WIND UP
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0034568_0034638 YEAH SURE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0035320_0035360 OKAY
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0036111_0036146 OKAY
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0038132_0038212 OF COURSE YEAH
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0038308_0038440 OKAY SO THAT'S SOMETHING
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0041820_0041895 OKAY SO
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042540_0042574 OKAY
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042700_0042838 ALRIGHT THANKS FOR THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042838_0043738 UM ALRIGHT NOW OTHER THINGS THAT I FOUND OUT ON IN MY RESEARCH IS THAT THE COMPLAINTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT THE REMOTE CONTROLS THAT ARE OUT THERE NOW
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0043738_0044093 'CAUSE A LOT OF THEM TAKE TOO MUCH TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044093_0044900 AND THAT WAS THIRTY FOUR PERCENT BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THE THING THAT WE DID ADDRESS IN OUR LAST MEETING THAT FREQUENTLY IT'S LOST SOMEWHERE IN THE ROOM
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044900_0045388 UM SO THOSE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE DEFINITELY DO WANNA ADDRESS
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0045388_0046099 UH WE WANNA S MAKE IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE WE WANNA MAKE IT UM OBVIOUS AND INTUITIVE TO USE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0046099_0047160 AND THEN THE THINGS ABOUT FINDING IT WE TALKED ABOUT THE A LIGHT EMITTING THING AS WELL AS UH MAYBE A BEEP
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047160_0047734 AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THINGS AFTER MY RESEARCH THAT WE DEFINITELY WANNA TRY TO INCORPORATE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047734_0047873 'KAY CAN WE GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047965_0048737 OKAY SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN THIS UM PROJECT ARE REALLY HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SIZZLE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0048737_0049169 THAT IS THE SELLING POINT THE THING THAT'S GONNA MAKE IT AN IMPULSE PURCHASE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049169_0049802 UH BECAUSE ONCE THERE'S NO BE BACK WELL IN SALES THEY ALWAYS SAY YOU KNOW BE BACKS DON'T COME BACK
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049802_0050107 IF SOMEBODY SAYS OH I'LL COME BACK AND GET IT NEXT WEEK YOU'RE DEAD
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050107_0050250 THEY'RE NEVER GONNA COME BACK AND BUY IT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050250_0050983 YOU'VE GOTTA MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH SO THEY BUY IT NOW NOW NOW W NOW IS A BIG WORD IN IN MY BOOK FOR SELLING THIS THING
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051054_0051832 AND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT REALLY SELLABLE WE'VE GOTTA SHORTEN THE LEARNING CURVE MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051832_0052603 WE HAVE TO HAVE AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE MORE BUTTONS IS MORE CONFUSION SO THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING SIMPLICITY IS GOOD
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052603_0052895 FINDING IT'S IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T USE IT IF YOU CAN'T FIND IT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052895_0053566 SO WE'VE GOTTA CONCENTRATE ON THE FEATURES THAT HELP YOU FIND IT AND I'VE ALREADY SAID THIS SEVERAL TIMES BUT I PUT IT DOWN IN WRITING HERE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053566_0053911 IT SHOULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE IMPULSE PURCHASE AT TWENTY FIVE EUROS
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053911_0054476 SO IT HAS TO HAVE ENOUGH VALUE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY LOOKS AT IT THEY SAY UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054476_0054921 HAS TO BE SO GREAT THAT THEY'RE GONNA SAY UH TWENTY FIVE EUROS ISN'T MUCH
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054921_0055696 UM AND THEN MAYBE A MOTTO LIKE WE PUT FASHION IN ELECTRONICS MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE CAN USE IN OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0055696_0055895 OKAY THAT'S UH ABOUT IT FOR ME RIGHT NOW
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0061329_0061363 OKAY

AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0083710_0083926 WELL WE ALREADY ELIMINATED THAT
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085300_0085700 NOW THAT'S GOOD FROM A MARKETING POINT OF VIEW THE FUN THE FUN SHAPE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085700_0085982 AND THAT YOU YOU SAY THAT WON'T ADD TOO MUCH TO THE BUDGET
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085982_0086172 TO D THE SHAPE IS UH
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0087557_0088267 DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE OF UM HAVING SER IN HAVING BASICALLY THE SAME MACHINE WITH THE SAME BUTTONS BUT MAYBE SEVERAL DIFFERENT SHAPES
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0088416_0088504 IS THAT GONNA BE A POSSIBLE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0088504_0088682 'CAUSE THAT MIGHT HELP WITH THE MARKETING
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0089144_0090328 BECAUSE WE HAD SOMETHING SORT OF SEXY FOR ADULTS AND WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING SORT OF SILLY FOR CHILDREN OR A LITTLE ANIMAL SHAPE OR IN A OR A LITTLE ELEPHANT SO THEY CAN REMEMBER WHERE IT IS
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0093425_0093497 MM

AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0093904_0094930 I THINK I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS UM WITH THE USER INTERFACE PERSON BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR ONE BUTTON FOR ONE FEATURE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0094930_0095705 BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WERE COMPLAINING ABOUT IN MY WHAT I FOUND OUT IN MY RESEARCH IS WHEN THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO LEARN A NEW ONE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0095705_0096316 THE CHANGING MODES WAS SOMETHING I MEAN YOU AND I ALL F ALL FOUR OF US WE WORK WITH COMPUTERS ALL THE TIME

AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0097752_0098520 AND THAT'S AND THAT'S THE KIND OF THING PEOPLE LEARN BY FEEL AND UM YOU DON'T FEEL THE MODE CHANGE
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0098520_0099118 SO UM MAYBE HAVING BUTTONS BE VARIOUS SHAPES MIGHT BE A HELP TOO
AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0099118_0100076 YOU KNOW LIKE THE A TRIANGLE IS FOR THE VOLUME AND A SQUARE IS FOR CHANGING CHANNELS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN UH DEVELOP A TACTILE SENSE OF IT

AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0014410_0015315 THE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER UM PRESENTED HER UH THOUGHTS ON THE ISSUE
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0015315_0016438 SHE WOULD LIKE A SPECIAL CASE MADE OUT OF PLASTIC THAT IS VERY STRONG NOT USING ANY HARMFUL MATERIALS SHOULD BE RECYCLABLE AND SHOULD BE COLOURFUL
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0016564_0017116 SHOULD HAVE AN INTEGRATED CIRCUIT BOARD THAT'S HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED AND TEMPERATURE RESISTANT
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0017284_0018010 SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A TIMER AND OR ALARM FACILITY INTEGRATED
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0018010_0019144 UH TECHNICALLY THIS THING WOULD ALSO HAVE A RESISTOR AND A CAPACITOR DIODE TRANSISTOR RESONATOR AND IF POSSIBLE A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019263_0019471 UH AND OF COURSE A CIRCUIT BOARD
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019599_0019852 AND HOW IT WOULD WORKS YOU PRESS THE BUTTON
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0019852_0022001 THE CHIP IS MORSE MORSE CODE RELATED RELAYS THE UH TO THE GENERAT TO THE GENERATOR AMPLIFICATION AND UH THE CIRCUIT BOARD IS VERY INEXPENSIVE TO BUILD AND SO SHE THINKS THIS IS A GREAT FEATURE UH TO TO TO CONSIDER
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022216_0022696 SHE WOULD LIKE UH THIS WHOLE THING SHOULD BE PUSH BUTTONS WITH A SIMPLE CHIP
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0022804_0023264 UH SCROLLING METHOD IS MORE EXPENSIVE AND NOT THAT PRACTICAL ANYMORE
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0023384_0023891 SHOULD BE BATTERY OPERATED AND OF COURSE SHE WOULD HAVE THE SPECIAL CASES
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0024040_0025146 THE MARKETING EXPERT UH WHO HAS TO FINALLY COME UP WITH TO TO TO MARKET THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN WATCHING THE COMPETITION
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0025146_0026273 HAS DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND ALSO HAS USED H HER PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS TO COME UP WITH THE FACT THAT SUCH A REMOTE SH SHOULD BE SMALL
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0026431_0026654 EASY TO USE AND IT SHOULD BE EYE CATCHING
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0027036_0027745 FROM HER POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTS IS THAT WE SHOULD GET TO MARKET BEFORE OUR COMPETITION DOES
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0028058_0029057 TO DO THAT UH MAYBE ONE OR TWO FEATURES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED ON WHICH WE COULD DWELL ON OR IN OTHER WORDS ON WHICH OUR CAMPAIGN COULD BE BUILT ON
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029213_0029697 TOO MANY NEW FEATURES OR TOO MANY POINTS WOULD ONLY CONFUSE MATTER
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0029697_0030149 SO WE PREFER TO HAVE ONE OR TWO FEATURES THAT CAN BE REALLY UH DRIVEN HOME
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030288_0030916 UM IT SHOULD HAVE A FRUIT AND VEGETABLE DESIGN AND SHOULD HAVE A SOFT FEEL
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0030916_0031126 SHE FEELS THAT'S REALLY WHAT PEOPLE WANT TODAY
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0031293_0032097 AND THE DECISION THAT WE TOOK LAST TIME WAS THAT UH THE SPECIAL FEATURE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS A SPEECH RECOGNISER
AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0032218_0033189 THE ENERGY SHOULD BE BATTERY UH SHOULD BE ON A CHIP SHOULD BE TRENDY DESIGN COMPACT AND STRONG AND SHOULD HAVE BUTTONS

AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0083631_0084232 WELL I THINK IF WE ARE GONNA USE A TOUCHSCREEN UH WE'RE GONNA GO WAY ABOVE THE TWELVE AND A HALF EUROS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266 BUT THE IT WOULDN'T BE VERY ROBUST
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531 IT'S VERY FRAGILE AND YOU CAN GET SCRATCHES ON IT
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0090168_0090216 THAT'S
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0090492_0090533 OKAY
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777 OKAY I'VE GOT A PRESENTATION ABOUT THE WORKING DESIGN
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003 UM FIRST ABOUT HOW IT WORKS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099 IT'S REALLY SIMPLE OF COURSE
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285 EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW A REMOTE WORKS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468 THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999 THE REMOTE DETERMINES WHAT BUTTON IT IS USES THE INFRARED TO SEND A SIGNAL TO THE T. V.
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301 THE T. V. SWITCHES TO THE FREQUENCY OR WHAT FUNCTION IT IS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811 SO WE'VE GOT UM THE THE PLATE
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206 IT GOTS CONDUCTIVE DISKS FOR EVERY BUTTON
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983 WHEN THE USER PRESSES A BUTTON A SIGNAL GOT SENT GOES TO THE LED AND TRANSMITS TRANMI TRANSMITS ITS TO THE T. V.
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340 IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DEVICE TECHNICALLY SPEAKING
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614 SO THIS IS A SCHEMATIC OVERVIEW
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802 YOU'VE GOT THE BUTTONS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017 THE POWER SOURCE
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468 AND UH WHEN A BUTTON GETS PRESSED ITS GOES TO THE CHIP
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059 THE CHIP UH CONTROLS THE INFRARED BULB AND PERF PERHAPS A NORMAL BULB
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324 WHEN YOU PRESS A BUTTON YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOUR PRESSED BUTTON
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094 WELL UM I THINK WE SHOULD USE DEFAULT MATERIALS SIMPLE PLASTICS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441 KEEP THE INNER WORKINGS SIMPLE SO IT'S ROBUST
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841 UH I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON AESTHETICS THE DESIGN AND THE USER INTERFACE
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301 BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE HIGH TECH MATERIALS THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO SKY HIGH
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105 AND UH YOU ONLY HAVE TO DESIGN A REMOTE ONCE AND IF YOU USE HIGH TECH MATERIALS IT COME BACK IN EVERY PRODUCT
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046 SO IT'S IN MY IDEA IT'S UH IT'S GONNA BE SMART TO INVEST IN DI IN DESIGN AND NOT IN UH IN THE PRODUCT ITSELF
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250 THAT'S IT
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073 I THINK THAT IF WE'RE IF WE PUT OUR MARKETING RIGHT UM WE CAN SELL THIS JUST LIKE UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IT IN THE NEWS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281 THE THE ELDERLY MOBILE PHONE
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249 YEAH IF WE IF WE MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL JUST L WITH THAT IDEA IN MIND WE COULD MAKE TONS OF MONEY I THINK
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872 WE DON'T HAVE TO FOCUS ON ON ON THE ON THE DESIGN THEN BUT ON FUNCTIONALITY
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940 WE JUST
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346 CHANGE OUR FOCUS ON THE PROJECT AND I THINK
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636 WE CAN UH WE CAN SELL THIS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0147440_0147464 NO
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330 UH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA

AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275 AND BESIDES THAT IT'S UM IF WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON ELDERLY PEOPLE THEY'LL HAVE TO ADAPT
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163275_0163548 THEY'RE NOT USED TO USING SCROLL BUTTONS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0163548_0163860 SO PERHAPS WE SHOULD S STICK TO THE BASIC LAYOUT
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177261_0177426 IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE YES
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177426_0177604 IF IT'S NOT TOO FANCY
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0177604_0177913 AND IF THE REMOTE STAYS RATHER SMALL IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0178569_0178612 YES
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0179700_0179902 SO WE'RE JUST GONNA FOCUS ON THE EXTRAS
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0180124_0180142 YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0183158_0183548 LIKE WITH YOUR KEY CHAIN IF YOU WHISTLE IT GOES UH IT MAKES A SOUND

AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0186523_0186974 Y I UM I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE DOCKING STATION OR THE SCREEN 'CAUSE
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0187119_0187191 IT'S UH
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0205739_0206094 WELL I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TELEVISION SETS UH
AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0206234_0206344 IN UH EVERY COUNTRY

AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0018276_0018355 THINK I'LL GO FIRST
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020659_0020685 'KAY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020685_0020813 MY NAME IS FREEK VAN PONNEN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020813_0020965 I'M THE MARKET EXPERT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0020965_0021091 BUT YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021210_0021426 UM I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0021426_0022302 WE HAVE WE UH HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH IN A USABILITY LAB WHERE WE OBSERVED UM USERS OPERATING REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022302_0022556 UH WE LET THEM FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022556_0022822 WE HAD ONE HUNDRED OF THESE UH TEST SUBJECTS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0022936_0023220 UH IN ADDITION WE DID SOME MARKET RESEARCH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023220_0023526 UH SEE WHAT THE MARKET CONSISTS OF
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023526_0023664 WHAT AGES ARE INVOLVED
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0023890_0024460 WELL THESE ARE THREE QUITE ASTONISHING RESULTS I THOUGHT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024460_0024753 UM REMOTES ARE BEING CONSIDERED UGLY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0024753_0024963 F UH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025097_0025633 PEOPLE QUESTIONED UH INDICATED THAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR REMOTE WERE WAS UGLY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0025633_0026285 UM AND AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTY PERCENT INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD SPEND MORE MONEY ON A FANCY LOOKING REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026285_0026336 SO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026467_0026733 UM IN ADDITION REMOTES WERE NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0026733_0027332 FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THEY ONLY LOO USED ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0027508_0027939 AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THAT THEIR REMOTE TENDED TO GET LOST IN THEIR ROOM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028047_0028080 SO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028233_0028307 SOME THINGS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028533_0028894 THEN WE DID SOME RESEARCH TO THE MOST RELEVANT FUNCTIONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0028894_0029664 CHANNEL SELECTION AND VOLUME SELECTION UM BOTH GOT A TEN ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN FOR RELEVANCY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029664_0029867 THE POWER BUTTON GOT A NINE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0029867_0030117 AND TELETEXT GOT A SIX AND A HALF
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030117_0030222 SO THESE ARE THE MOST
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030335_0030700 MOST UH IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ON A REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030700_0030927 THEN THERE ARE SOME ONE TIME USE FUNCTION
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0030927_0031087 THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO CALL THEM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031087_0031550 THAT UH AUDIO SETTINGS VIDEO SETTINGS AND CHANNEL SETTINGS BUTTONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0031550_0032074 WHICH ARE NOT REALLY USED VERY FREQUENTLY BUT ARE STILL CONSIDERED TO BE OF SOME IMPORTANCE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032210_0032702 UM CHANNEL SELECTION WAS ALSO INDICATED TO BE USED VERY FREQUENTLY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0032702_0032943 ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT TIMES PER HOUR
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033214_0033502 THEN THESE ARE THE THIS IS THE MARKET
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0033502_0034115 UM SIXTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET CONSISTS OF USERS BETWEEN THE AGES SIXTEEN AND FORTY F SIX
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034213_0034273 UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034414_0034874 MAIN CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS GROUP IS THAT THEY'RE VERY CRITICAL ON THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0034874_0035285 UM THEY LIKE TO USE NEW F NEW FUNCTIONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035285_0035438 BUT THEY ALSO ARE VERY CRITICAL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035438_0035637 THEY WON'T SPEND THEIR MONEY VERY EASILY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035637_0035695 SO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0035786_0036423 UM THE USERS OF FORTY SIX TO SIXTY FIVE YEARS CONS THE MAKE UP FORTY PERCENT OF THE MARKET
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036524_0036731 THEY ARE NOT REALLY VERY INTERESTED IN FEATURES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0036731_0036997 BUT THEY DO TEND TO SPEND THEIR MONEY A LOT EASIER
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037383_0037438 UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037535_0037811 WHAT I THINK THIS INDICATES FOR OUR UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0037943_0038068 DESIGN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038068_0038336 I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE A REMOTE FOR THE FUTURE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038336_0038480 AND THIS MEANS WE WOULD
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0038600_0038984 UM HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE AGE AGES SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0039082_0039938 UH THIS ALSO MAKES UP MOST THE BIGGEST PART OF THE MARKET SO THAT WILL ALSO BE WHERE OUR MAIN PROFIT WOULD BE GETTABLE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040047_0040342 UM THIS WOULD MEAN WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A FANCY DESIGN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040485_0040559 UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0040660_0041614 THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT UM ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE PEOPLE QUESTIONED THOUGHT THAT THE REMOTE CONTROL CAUSED R. S. R. S. I.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0041757_0042217 UM THIS IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042217_0042921 AND THIRTY FOUR PERCENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HARD TO LEARN A N HOW TO OPERATE A NEW CONTROL REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0042921_0043379 SO THESE ARE TWO FACTORS THAT I THINK SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DESIGN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043379_0043672 BESIDES OF COURSE THAT THE REMOTE MUST LOOK VERY NICE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0043807_0043933 AND THE FUNCTIONALITY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044041_0044727 AS A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THEY ONLY USE ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE BUTTONS I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE VERY FEW BUTTONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0044727_0045175 UH THIS WILL ALSO BE UH BENEFICIAL TO THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045327_0045670 UH I THINK THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED BUTTONS SHOULD BE EMPHASISED
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0045670_0046162 ESPECIALLY THE CHANNEL SELECTION AND AUDIO UH SELECTION BUTTONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046162_0046539 'CAUSE THEY'RE USED MOST AND SO THEY SHOULD BE ROBUST
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046539_0046695 THEY SHOULDN'T BREAK DOWN EASILY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0046916_0047001 UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047164_0047851 THEN AS MO AS A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THAT THEIR UM REMOTE GOT LOST IN THE ROOM IT MIGHT BE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0047962_0048678 AND I SAY MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT WOULD UM CERTAINLY BOOST THE UH PRODUCTION COSTS A LOT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048678_0048985 BUT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO MAKE A DOCKING STATION
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0048985_0049629 AND THIS WOULD COULD GET A BUTTON IN IT WHICH WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE WHICH WOULD THEN BEEP
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049655_0049890 SO YOU'D KNOW WHERE IT IS IN THE ROOM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0049890_0050392 AND IN ADDITION TO THIS IT COULD UM RECHARGE THE BATTERIES IN THE REMOTE IF YOU PUT IT IN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0050571_0051711 THEN UM A SURPRISINGLY GREAT DEAL OF PEOPLE W INDICATED THAT UM AN L. C. D. SCREEN IN THE REMOTE CONTROL WOULD BE PREFERRED
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051711_0051826 THIS WAS UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0051958_0052436 MOSTLY PEOPLE IN THE AGE OF SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052436_0052805 BUT UP TILL FORTY FIVE IT REMAINS FEASIBLE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0052805_0053574 THIS WOULD ALSO GREATLY INCREASE THE PRODUCTION COSTS BUT I THINK THESE ARE JUST SOME SMALL FACTORS WE COULD CONSIDER
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0053859_0053925 THAT WOULD BE ALL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0054420_0054490 ANY QUESTIONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0055033_0055053 'KAY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0057741_0058050 YEAH YOU SHOULD GO TO THE TOP THINGY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0058050_0058150 SLIDE SHOW
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0058150_0058187 OH YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088330_0088356 HMM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088627_0088837 WELL IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A FANCY DESIGN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0088990_0089060 SO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0089544_0089606 THAT IS TRUE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0089709_0089819 WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0090166_0090187 YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0117494_0117796 SO IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION POSSIBLE ABOUT THE NEW PRODUCT REQUIREMENT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0118933_0119896 YEAH 'CAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT TELETEXT IS GONNA BE AN OLD FEATURE AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE USED ANYMORE ANYWAY PRETTY SOON
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0119896_0120197 AND NEW T. V. S WILL HAVE INTERNET ACCESS ON THEM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120197_0120863 BUT I THINK IF YOU'RE TARGETING PEOPLE OF FORTY PLUS THE CHANCE THAT THEY WILL HAVE A T. V. WITH INTERNET ACCESS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278 WITHIN THE NEXT LIKE TWENTY YEARS IS VERY SLIM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133 IN ADDITION PEOPLE INDICATED THAT TELETEXT SIMPLY WAS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543 SO I THINK IT'S PRETTY DUMB TO PUT NO TELETEXT FEATURE ON IT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840 I'M PRETTY MUCH AGAINST IT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123095_0123267 YES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123533_0123878 BESIDES THAT I THINK THE MARKET FOR FORTY PLUS IS LIKE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0123983_0124063 PRETTY SMALL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0124320_0124873 BUT I MEAN IF I S IF I SEE THIS IT'S I THINK WE'RE JUST GONNA GO FOR ANOTHER
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125042_0125083 PRETTY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439 AND NOT INNOVATIVE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125565_0125638 REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129104_0129298 YES BUT IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST PART OF THE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129420_0129457 MARKET
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973 AND BESIDES THAT THEY'RE NOT VERY CRITICAL SO I MEAN THEY DON'T REALLY CARE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315 WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL IS LIKE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130315_0130688 THEY'LL JUST PRETTY MUCH TAKE THE FIRST THING THEY SEE AND WHICH LOOKS ACCEPTABLE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0132695_0132722 NO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0132822_0132961 I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IN THE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133100_0133414 SIXTEEN TO FORTY FIVE AGE CATEGORY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077 BECAUSE THEY ARE CRITICAL AND THEY THEY WANT TO HAVE A FANCY REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605 PEOPLE OF FORTY PLUS I MEAN THEY WANT IT TO WORK BUT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134753_0134976 AS SOO AS SOON AS IT WORKS IT'S OKAY WITH THEM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0135321_0135379 SO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0136509_0136610 I HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0137193_0137215 HMM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0142396_0142426 YES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0142746_0142789 YES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0143035_0143275 BUT OBVIOUSLY THE BOARD TENDS TO DISAGREE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0146351_0146443 YEAH ALSO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0146664_0146971 I THINK IT'D DEFINITELY BE A BAD IDEA NOT TO INCLUDE TELETEXT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0152762_0152799 YES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0153307_0153333 MM-HMM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0153595_0153625 BUT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0153794_0154038 I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE ANY MORE 'CAUSE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154163_0154263 WELL MIGHT BE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154417_0154858 BUT I MEAN IT IF IT'S ONLY FOR T. V. YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED A LOT OF BUTTONS ANYWAY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0154858_0155329 YOU NEED A ONE TO ZERO BUTTON NEXT CHANNEL PREVIOUS CHANNEL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0155441_0155821 VOLUME UP VOLUME DOWN AND SOME TELETEXT BUTTONS BUT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0156213_0156360 I THINK IF YOU IF YOU ONLY L
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0156741_0156811 NAH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157258_0157508 THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA INCLUDE TELETEXT YOU DO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157508_0157740 I THINK MANY PEOPLE LIKE TO USE THAT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0157740_0158506 'CAUSE IF YOU SHOULD IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH FROM CHANNEL ONE TO LIKE THIRTY FIVE YOU DON'T WANNA PUSH THE NEXT CHANNEL BUTTON THIRTY FIVE TIMES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160326_0160525 THAT'S TRUE BUT UM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0160699_0161089 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY T. V. S THAT CAN SWITCH CHANNELS THAT FAST
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161089_0161238 AND SO YOU WOULD NEED LIKE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0161363_0161899 THE T. V. WOULD NEED AN A FUNCTION WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY VIEW ALL CHANNELS AND SCROLL THROUGH IT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162025_0162220 AND I DUNNO IF MANY CHANNELS WOULD
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162420_0162508 DO HAVE THAT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0162508_0162612 IF MANY T. V. S HAVE THAT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0163581_0163611 MM-HMM
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0165401_0166063 BUT I DON'T THINK I THINK IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY TO OPERATE A T. V. YOU THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN GAIN ON
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166167_0166497 UM HAVING AS FEW BUTTONS AS POSSIBLE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0166497_0167313 'CAUSE I THINK THERE ARE PRETTY MANY REMOTE CONTROLS THAT CAN ONLY OPERATE A T. V. WHICH ALREADY ONLY HAVE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF BUTTONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0167313_0167540 I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH TO BE GAINED IN THAT AREA
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0167779_0167803 YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0169161_0170001 THAT IS TRUE BUT I THINK THERE'S SIMPLY NOT MUCH TO GAIN ON THE COMPETITION WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE MAKING A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY FOR TO OPERATE ONLY THE T. V.
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0170217_0170897 'CAUSE IF YOU HAVE A A REMOTE CONTROL ONLY TO OPERATE A T. V. THERE'S SIMPLY NOT A LOT OF BUTTONS REQUIRED
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171006_0171553 THERE'S NOT A LOT OF FUNCTIONS REQUIRED SO MOST EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF BUTTONS EITHER
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0171766_0172184 SO I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY GAIN ON THE COMPETITION HERE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0172304_0172602 THAT WOULD THAT WOULD COST A A BIG MARKETING
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0172815_0172883 EXPEDITION
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0173040_0173099 WHICH WAS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0173197_0173663 ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS TO MAKE IT ONLY FOR THE T. V. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO MARKET A LOT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0174974_0175034 MAYBE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175279_0175308 WELL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845 YEAH I THINK MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY NEED A GOOD WAY TO POSITION ALL THE BUTTONS AND
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153 BUT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD SPEND VERY MUCH TIME IN THAT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428 YEAH I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD DO SOME RESEARCH INTO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733 WHAT ELDERLY PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE IN A
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180850_0181039 LIKE TO HAVE EXTRA IN A NEW REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182000_0182443 YES WELL FIFTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INDICATED THAT REMOTE CONTROL TENDED TO GET LOST
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188 YEAH THAT WAS WHAT I SUGGESTED
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919 YOU HAVE IT ON YEAH YOU HAVE IT'S ON SOME PHONES TOO WHICH HAVE A DOCKING STATION
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183919_0184252 AND YOU JUST PRESS A BUTTON AND THE PHONE GOES RINGING
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0184328_0184403 SO YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701 I THINK SINCE A LOT OF PEOPLE INDICATED THAT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL IS HARD TO LEARN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187701_0188355 AND WE'RE FOCUSING ON ELDERLY PEOPLE HERE WHICH TEND TO HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING NEW DEVICES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928 IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE JUST A LITTLE SCREEN ON IT WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN A BUTTON IF YOU PRESS IT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188928_0189068 WHICH WOULD TELL YOU WHAT IT DOES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747 AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE TOUCHSCREEN OR A VERY EXPENSIVE SCREEN BUT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0190238_0190469 JUST A SMALL SCREEN WITH TWO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0190696_0190736 YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191151_0191307 BUT I DUNNO IF THAT WOULD
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191519_0191635 THAT WOULD FIT INTO THE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0191972_0192028 COSTS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0197520_0197579 NO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0197899_0198437 I THINK PROBABLY ELDERLY PEOPLE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CAREFUL WITH THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS THAN
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0198553_0198610 YOUNGSTERS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0200937_0200954 YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0201108_0201183 I THINK
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202427_0202807 I THINK THAT WOULD BE A IF WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT WOULD BE A
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0202807_0203198 I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR UH FOR THE IMAGE OF THE COMPANY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203379_0203681 AND I THINK I THINK THERE WOULD BE A GOOD MARKET FOR IT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0203850_0204211 IF WE'RE ABLE TO REALLY BRING AN INNOVATIVE PRODUCT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0204510_0204648 YEAH THE REALLY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0204830_0204856 BUT
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0205042_0205196 I'D HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT A LITTLE MORE
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0206967_0207058 'KAY
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207058_0207517 AND WITH UH THE LITTLE SCREEN IN IT WHICH EXPLAINS THE BUTTONS
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207517_0207794 YOU COULD I THINK WE N IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0207894_0208113 ADAPT IT TO DIFFERENT CULTURES
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0208317_0208346 YEAH
AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0209025_0209057 YEAH

AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0043495_0043736 ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE THE TRENDS

AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044059_0044222 NO
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0044222_0044365 OKAY WE GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0079424_0079455 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0079633_0079787 UH THANK YOU
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0091621_0091739 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0091739_0091784 THANK YOU
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0092009_0092432 SO THAT BRINGS US TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR CONCEPTS
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0092695_0092781 MM
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0093463_0093494 'KAY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825 SO THESE ARE THE POINTS WE HAVE TO DISCUSS
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318 UM FIRST
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021 I THINK WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE ENERGY SOURCE SINCE THAT'S UM
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908 HAS A PRETTY BIG INFLUENCE ON PRODUCTION PRICE UH AND IMAGE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011 UH SO
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927 UH F I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO SEE UH IT IS POSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE KINETIC ENERGY IN OUR BUDGET I THINK
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0098232_0098266 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0098483_0098778 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0099066_0099103 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0099559_0099616 NO
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0099941_0100038 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0100038_0100106 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0100848_0100884 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0103768_0103813 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0106873_0106921 UH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077 UH WELL I THINK UH ELDERLY PEOPLE JUST LIKE TO HAVE EVERYTHING IN PLACE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773 AND I DON'T THINK THEY THEY LIKE UH REMOTES JUST LAYING EVERYWHERE IN THEIR ROOMS
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157 SO MAYBE A DOCKING STATION WILL HELP THEM GIVE THE REMOTE A PLACE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369 AND ALSO WHAT YOU SAID
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186 UM YOU CAN INTRODUCE VOICE RECOGNITION BY UH FINDING BACK YOUR REMOTE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964 BUT I THINK IT'S UM MORE EFFICIENT AND CHEAPER TO PUT IT IN THE DOCKING STATION
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441 SO YOU HAVE A BUT BUTTON ON YOUR DOCKING STATION WHICH YOU CAN PUSH AND THEN IT STARTS BEEPING
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214 AND THEN WE CAN WE CAN STILL USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUT MAYBE THEN FOR ONLY THE THE CHANNELS
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396 THAT'S SAFE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0113024_0113083 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198 THAT'S A GOOD POINT
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438 YEAH SURE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477 GO AHEAD
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0116786_0116827 NO
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0117647_0117690 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0118313_0118330 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121195_0121266 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791 EASIER TO USE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961 NO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0124035_0124069 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054 I PERSONALLY THINK THE L. C. D. SCREEN WE WANNA USE WITH THE EXTRA INFORMATION I THINK NOBODY HAS ANYTHING AGAINST IT
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507 BECAUSE IT'S JUST UH SOME EXTRA INFORMATION AND IT'S EASY TO IGNORE AS WELL
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757 SO IF YOU DON'T WANNA USE IT YOU JUST DON'T USE IT
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889 AND UM YEAH I THINK THE UM MAYBE WE HAVE TO UH DISCARD THE VOICE RECOGNITION
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431 BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE COST UH SIGNIFI UH SIGNIFICANTLY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946 AND I DON'T THINK THE I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER TO USE AS WELL
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372 SO THAT BRINGS US BACK TO THE ENERGY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126 IF WE DON'T HAVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IT WILL IT WON'T USE A LOT OF ENERGY TO USE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0129126_0129227 UM
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356 SO IN THAT CASE WE COULD USE KINETIC UH ENERGY BUT I THINK JUST A SIMPLE BATTERY WHICH YOU CAN RELOAD ON A DOCKING STATION IS JUST AS GOOD
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466 AND MUCH CHEAPER AS WELL
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130585_0130650 SO
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353 OKAY LET ME JUST CHOOSE FOR THE BATTERY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484 THAT BRINGS US TO THE CHIP
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847 JUST THE ADVANCED
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465 OKAY ADVANCED CHIP
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455 AND THEN WE GET TO THE POINT OF THE CASE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119 UM WHICH BRINGS US A LITTLE BIT BACK TO MARKETING AS WELL
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652 UH IF WE WANNA CHOOSE FOR WOOD OR THE BLACK AND GREY
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732 OR BOTH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723 UM AS WE SAW THERE IS NOT YEAH WOOD IS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE TO PRODUCE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033 UM BUT I THINK IT WILL ATTRACT ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO WANNA HAVE SOMETHING EXCLUSIVE WHICH THEY CAN SHOW OFF TO THEIR GRANDKIDS
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275 LOOK I'VE GOT A NEW REMOTE CONTROL AND UH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138050_0138085 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399 THAT'S RIGHT
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850 BUT WITH COLOUR WAS A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138850_0138904 OR
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038 YOU DON'T KNOW
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515 I THINK SO BECAUSE YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064 IT'S A LOT MORE DIFFICULT TO TO HANDLE AND TO TO GET IN THE RIGHT SHAPE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141387_0141421 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896 CHANGE THE CASES
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141896_0141939 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413 YOU CAN SELL THE CASES
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143413_0143544 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794 I THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD OPTION
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768 BECAUSE UM THEN YOU CAN ADVERTISE AS WELL WITH THE GIVE YOUR GRANDFATHER A NEW CASE FOR HIS REMOTE CONTROL OR WHATEVER
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796 BECAUSE THAT'S A IT'S SOMETHING EXTRA IT'S SOMETHING OTHER REMOTES DON'T HAVE WHICH WE CAN GET A GREAT ADVANTAGE POINT
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959 SO AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE THEM WITH COLOUR
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145 BLACK AND GREY OTHER COLOURS AS WELL
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0146605_0146674 COSTS

AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148294_0148357 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148357_0148770 SO YOU SUGGEST WE SHOULD DESIGN TWO DIFFERENT TELEPHONES
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0148893_0149830 ON WHICH YOU CAN APPLY YEAH REMOTE CONTROLS ON WHICH YOU CAN APPLY DIFFERENT CASE COVERS FOR EXAMPLE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0150218_0150259 REMOTE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0150779_0150812 YEAH

AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151424_0151767 SO EVERYBODY'S OKAY WITH THE CHANGING COVERS
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0151853_0152059 I THINK THAT'S A GOOD UH GOOD OPTION
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0152388_0152555 CHANGING CASE COVERS
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0153123_0153158 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0156662_0156717 MM

AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157441_0157677 IT'S HAS TO BE POSSIBLE TO STAND UP
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0157677_0157912 OR JUST ONLY TO LIE DOWN
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158050_0158416 AND THE THE COVER OF THE THE DOCKING STATION IS ALSO
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158525_0158749 ON TOP OF THE TELEVISION THEN
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0158749_0158792 OR NOT

AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160188_0160709 UM MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE A LITTLE DRAWING OF IT ON THE
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0160901_0161144 ON THE THE BOARD

AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171349_0171495 SO PEOPLE CAN GET CONFUSED
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0171773_0172086 ESPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE THE SAME WRITINGS ON IT
AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0172641_0173234 CAN'T WE MAKE UH CAN'T WE MAKE A REMOTE WHICH YOU CAN FLIP OVER AND USE

AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0080771_0080833 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081438_0081673 ABOUT THE COMPONENTS DESIGN
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0081673_0082321 UM FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE WE CAN USE A BASIC BATTERY OR A AS AN OPTIONAL THING
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082321_0082829 A KINETIC ENERGY LIKE IN A WATCH WHICH YOU JUST SHAKE AND IT PRODUCES ENERGY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0082829_0083360 BUT IF WE CHOOSE FOR THAT OPTION THE DOCKING STATION WOULD C BECOME OBSOLETE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083360_0083601 SO I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY AN OPTION
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0083687_0084583 UH FOR THE CASING UH THE UH MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT CAN DELIVER UH A FLAT CASING SINGLE OR DOUBLE CURVED CASING
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084583_0084859 IT'S REALLY UP THE THE DESIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA USE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0084859_0085347 IT'S UH DOESN'T UH IMPLY ANY TECHNICAL RESTRICTIONS
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0085424_0086153 UH AS A CASE SUPPLEMENT WE COULD UM I THOUGHT OF THAT L LATER UH A RUBBER UH BELT LIKE A ANTI SLIP
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086341_0086677 UH FOR THE B BUTTONS WE CAN USE PLASTIC OR RUBBER
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0086677_0087326 AND THE CHIP SET UM IT SAYS SIMPLE HERE BUT IT SHOULD BE ADVANCED BECAUSE WE'RE USING AN L. C. D. UH SCREEN
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0087418_0088026 AND AS UH THE TREND WATCHER PRESENTATION SHOWED UM PEOPLE LIKE WOOD
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088026_0088725 BUT IT RAISES THE PRICE AND IT DOESN'T REALLY FIT THE IMAGE UNLESS WE WOULD START TWO PRODUCT LINES
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088725_0088913 FORM SHOULD FOLLOW FUNCTION OVERALL
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0088970_0089554 UM WELL THE KINETIC ENERGY SOURCE IS RATHER FANCY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089554_0089817 BUT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE WANT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0089817_0090047 I THINK WE SHOULD DISC DISCUSS THAT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090047_0090706 UM FOR THE CASE UH THE SUPPLEMENT AND THE BUTTONS IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE DESIGNER
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0090706_0091523 AND THE CHIP SET UH REALLY SHOULD BE ADVANCED BECAUSE OTHERWISE UH IT WOULD REALLY BE A SIMPLE UH REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0091523_0091576 AND THAT'S IT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097798_0097992 YES W THERE THERE ARE FOUR OPTIONS
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0097992_0098273 WE COULD USE THE BASIC NORMAL BATTERY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098273_0098436 UH A HAND DYNAMO
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098436_0098719 BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALLY AN OPTION
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0098719_0099113 YOU DON'T WANNA SWING BEFORE YOU CAN WATCH TELEVISION
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099113_0099261 UH SOLAR CELLS
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099261_0099667 BUT NOT EVERY ROOM IS VERY LIGHT SO IT'S NOT A VERY GOOD OPTION
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0099667_0099767 OR THE KINETIC ENERGY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0100360_0100754 WELL Y YOU BASICALLY SHAKE YOUR REMOTE AND THEN IT POWERS UP
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0100754_0100788 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0101648_0101742 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0101742_0101816 THAT'S TRUE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113138_0113402 MM I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON PRICING
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0113402_0113632 SO I'LL HAVE TO ASK THE MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118532_0118810 BUT THAT WOULD ALSO GO FOR THE L. C. D. SCREEN THEN I GUESS
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0118947_0119165 IT'S A BIT HIGHER PERCENTAGE BUT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0121230_0121267 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0130590_0130714 AND THAT'S THE BEST CHOICE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131552_0131947 WELL THERE ISN'T ANY CHOICE THERE BECAUSE WE'RE USING THE THE THE THE DISPLAY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0131947_0132100 SO IT'S GOTTA BE ADVANCED
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0138925_0139061 MM I DUNNO
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0139061_0139305 I'LL HAVE TO UH RESEARCH
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0151839_0151862 YES
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0153081_0153123 YES
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0153341_0154060 WELL THE THE GENERAL LIKE MOST OLDER REMOTES ARE FLAT JUST STRAIGHT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0154060_0154699 AND UH OUR D MANUFACTURING DEPARTMENT CAN ALSO DELIVER SINGLE CURVED OR DOUBLE CURVED CA CURVED CASES
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155007_0155622 UM IT WOULD JUST ONLY AFFECT THE FORM FOR AS FAR AS I KNOW
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003 SO IT'S J REALLY JUST UP TO THE DESIGN DEPARTMENT WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236 IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER FOR THE PRICE OR THE FUNCTIONALITY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156412_0156537 PICK ONE YOU LIKE YES
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0184999_0185035 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534 I THINK WE SHOULD START BY BY CHOOSING A CASE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785 BECAUSE THAT'S THE BASIS YOU'RE BUILDING ON
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445 SO I COULD DRAW THEM OUT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151 LET'S LOOK AT THE FLAT CASE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188271_0188330 OH
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358 IT'S FROM THE SIDE SO IT'S RATHER NORMAL
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993 THE THE SINGLE CURVED SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THEY'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632 SO THIS TYPE SHOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU OR BETTER SHOULD PREVENT REPETITIVE STRAIN INJURY A BIT
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274 AND THE DOUBLE CURVED S LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS I GUESS
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600 SO TH THOSE ARE THE THREE OPTIONS WE HAVE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0204954_0204969 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0207652_0208185 IT'S MORE LOGICAL TO HAVE IT ON TOP AS WELL BECAUSE LIKE ON YOUR MOBILE PHONE IT'S ALWAYS ABOVE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0208803_0209030 OH MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST S START ON A BLANK PAGE
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0221759_0221783 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0227998_0228028 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0002409_0002464 GOOD AFTERNOON
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018027_0018191 SURE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0018191_0018300 I'LL START OFF THEN
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0019277_0019334 DOH
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020397_0020995 'KAY I'M UH GONNA INFORM YOU ABOUT THE TREND WATCHING I'VE DONE OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0020995_0021224 UM WE'VE DONE SOME MARKET RESEARCH
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0021224_0021610 WE DISTRIBUTED SOME MORE ENQUETES QUESTIONNAIRES
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0021670_0022728 AND UM BESIDES THAT UM I DEPLOYED SOME TREND WATCHERS TO MILAN AND PARIS TO WELL GET ALL OF THE NEWEST TRENDS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0022728_0023525 AND I'VE CONSULTED SOME ADDITIONAL TREND WATCH TREND WATCHERS AFTER THE ORIGINAL TREND WATCHERS RETURN ABOUT WHAT THE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0023685_0024088 THE BEST DESIGN WOULD BE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024088_0024509 UM OKAY THESE ARE SOME OVERALL FINDINGS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024509_0024960 UM MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE FANCY DESIGN
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0024960_0025462 UM THE RESEARCH INDICATED THAT THAT WAS BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0025510_0026239 UM INNOVATIVENESS WAS ABOUT HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THE FANCY DESIGN
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026239_0026776 BY INNOVATIVENESS THIS MEANS UM FUNCTIONS WHICH ARE NOT FEATURED IN OTHER REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0026897_0027839 UM ABOUT HALF OF HALF AS IMPORTANT AS THE INNOVATIVENESS WAS THE WAS EASY TO USE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0027839_0029193 UM FOR OUR UM GROUP WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE OF SIXTY TO EIGHTY Y YEARS OLD THIS IS UM THESE FACTORS ARE SLIGHTLY MORE EQUAL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029507_0029830 'KAY THESE ARE SOME MORE GROUP SPECIFIC FINDINGS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0029830_0030102 UH THE OLDER PEOPLE PREFER DARK COLOURS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030102_0030533 UH THEY LIKE RECOGNISABLE SHAPES AND FAMILIAR MATERIAL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0030533_0031093 AND OUR SURVEYS HAVE INDICATED THAT ESPECIALLY WOOD IS PRETTY MUCH
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0031200_0031633 THE MATERIAL FOR OLDER PEOPLE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0031633_0032764 UM THIS IS THIS IMAGE WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN IMPRESSION ABOUT UM THE LOOK AND FEEL THAT UM THE REMOTE SHOULD HAVE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033107_0033520 UM THIS LEADS US TO SOME PERSONAL PREFERENCES
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0033520_0033933 UH THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE DOCKING STATION SHOULD UH BLEND IN IN THE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034045_0034226 IN THE ROOM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034226_0034797 UM SO THIS WOULD MEAN NO UH EYE CATCHING DESIGNS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0034797_0035557 JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE AND WELL THE DOCKING STATION AND SMALL SCREEN WOULD BE OUR MAIN POINTS OF INTEREST
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0035557_0036270 BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE THE THESE WOULD UH BE THE INNOVATIVENESS IN THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0036393_0036896 SO THIS WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE AT LEAST INCLUDE THESE FEATURES
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0036896_0037901 UM WELL THE TREND WATCHERS I CONSULTED ADVISED THAT IT B SHOULD BE THE REMOTE CONTROL AND THE DOCKING STATION SHOULD BE TELEPHONE SHAPED
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0037901_0038470 SO YOU COULD IMAGINE THAT UH THE REMOTE CONTROL WILL BE STANDING UP STRAIGHT IN THE DOCKING STATION
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0038550_0039085 THIS IS NOT REALLY THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A NEW SHAPE TO UH OLDER PEOPLE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039085_0039958 SO THEY WOULD PREFER UH A DESIGN WHERE THE REMOTE CONTROL JUST LIES FLAT IN THE DOCKING STATION
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0039958_0040170 SO IT WOULD BE KINDA MORE TELEPHONE SHAPED
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0040266_0041314 UM BESIDES THAT WE WOULD ADVISE UM TO BRING TWO EDITIONS ONE WITH A WOOD LIKE COLOUR AND MAYBE FEEL AND ONE WITH A GREY BLACK COLOUR
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041314_0041809 THE WOOD LIKE FOR THE MORE UH EXCLUSIVE PEOPLE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041809_0041998 PEOPLE WITH MORE MONEY
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0041998_0042227 UH THE GREY BLACK COLOUR FOR WELL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0042533_0042730 PEOPLE WITH LESS MEANS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0043097_0043203 THAT WOULD BE ALL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0043635_0043711 ANY QUESTIONS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100075_0100370 AND HOW EXACTLY DOES THE KINETIC ENERGY WORK
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100370_0100424 YOU JUST
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100516_0100747 YOU USE IT AND IT WORKS
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0100902_0101010 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101010_0101706 WELL PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK THAT OLDER PEOPLE LIKE TO SHAKE THEIR REMOTE CONTROL BEFORE THEY USE IT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0101923_0102499 AND BESIDES THAT YOU MENTIONED IT WOULD MAKE THE DOCKING STATION OBSOLETE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267 AND I THINK OUR DOCKING STATION COULD BE ONE OF THE MARKETING ISSUES WITH WHICH WE CAN UM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103372_0103559 GET GREAT POPULARITY FOR OUR PRODUCT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0103844_0104007 UM WEL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0104423_0105196 YEAH YOU COULD LOAD UP THE BATTERIES YOU COULD UM INSERT THE FIND THE LOST REMOTE CONTROL FUNCTION IN THERE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0107490_0107720 THAT'S TRUE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0112333_0112954 I'M WONDERING UM WHAT WILL THE VOICE RECOGNITION MEAN FOR THE PRODUCTION PRICE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0113733_0114557 'CAUSE IN OUR EARLIER UM MARKET RESEARCH IF YOU'D ALLOW ME TO GO TO THE FLAT BOARD SMARTBOARD
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115058_0115235 UM SO IT WAS OPEN HERE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115361_0115594 UM WE ALSO UM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0115913_0116369 ASKED IF W THEY WOULD IF PEOPLE WOULD PAY MORE FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION IN A REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116369_0116827 WELL YOU CAN SEE HERE OUR TARGET GROUP WOULD NOT DO THAT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229 SO IF THAT WOULD INCREASE THE PRICE FOR WHICH WE'RE SELLING OUR REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667 I WOULD GREATLY ADVISE NOT TO DO IT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175 I THINK THAT WOULD BE BETTER TO UH INSERT IN OUR OTHER PRODUCT THAT IS MEANT FOR THE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0118321_0118391 YOUNGER PEOPLE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119311_0119924 UM WELL THIS IS YEAH BUT THIS IS HERE THE QUESTION WAS WOULD YOU PREFER IT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250 SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY MEAN THEY WOULDN'T PAY EXTRA FOR IT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970 AND ON TOP OF THAT THE L. C. D. SCREEN WOULD UM HELP IN MAKING THE REMOTE CONTROL EASIER TO USE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0121214_0121773 AND I THINK A VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTION WOULD NOT MAKE THE REMOTE CONTROL MUCH EASIER TO USE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123063_0123744 UM WELL THIS WAS FOR LIKE AN L. C. D. SCREEN LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE ON A ON THE THE MOST ADVANCED MOBILE PHONES
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0123848_0123971 SO PRETTY LARGE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0132192_0132225 'KAY
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0135535_0135572 MM-HMM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0136887_0136936 MM-HMM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803 WELL AND I THINK MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR THERE IS THE WOODEN COLOUR
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136 SO IT WOULDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE WOOD IF IT'S JUST
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0138485_0138558 WOOD COLOURED
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0139459_0139560 PROBABLY
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0145395_0145574 YEAH THAT IS TRUE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146180_0146246 YEAH
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670 WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK CAREFULLY INTO THE DESIGN THOUGH
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517 'CAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE ONE W UH CONTROL WHICH WOULD FIT IN WITH A WOODEN COVER AND A
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147646_0147798 PLASTIC COVER
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0147798_0148153 THE MORE ORIGINAL ONE OR THE MORE STANDARD ONE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355 SO THAT WOULD
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184 WELL I WOULDN'T DESIGN A TELEPHONE BUT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094 WELL NO I THINK W WE SHOULD JUST WE SHOULD THEN JUST DESIGN ONE UM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867 ONE REMOTE BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE FANCY WITH EITHER THE WOOD COVER OR THE PLASTIC ONE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305 SO BUT THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151 UM I HEARD OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER TALK ABOUT UH FLAT SINGLE AND DOUBLE CURVED
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312 COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0154001_0154034 MM-HMM
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954 AND WHAT WOULD SINGLE CURVED AND DOUBLE CURVED MEAN
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0155992_0156033 OKAY
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539 SO WE CAN PRETTY MUCH JUST DO WHATEVER WE WANT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0156664_0156688 'KAY
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0156788_0156823 THAT'S GOOD
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0157846_0157967 NO JUST TO LIE DOWN
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229 WE'LL GO FOR THAT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158787_0158889 WELL OR BESIDES IT

AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0162457_0163200 UM YOU UH SAID YOU WANTED TO PUT THE UM CHANGING CHANNELS BUTTON ON THE RIGHT SIDE SO YOU COULD
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0163200_0164156 SO YOUR THUMB WOULD BE EASILY WELL UH I THINK THAT WAS A VERY GOOD POINT 'CAUSE I POINTED OUT EARLIER THAT A LOT OF REMOTES CAUSE R. S. I.
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164156_0164342 SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THAT
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0164342_0164900 UM I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD JUST MAKE ONE OF THOSE BUTTONS ON BOTH THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT SIDE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0165095_0165355 FOR LEFT HANDED USERS ALSO
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167654_0167860 FOR THE VOLUME
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0167860_0167985 UM WELL THAT COULD
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0168075_0168721 YEAH WE COULD DO THAT BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR THE EASY EASE OF USE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0169396_0170527 BUT IF WE WOULD MAKE UM A CHANGING CHANNELS AND CHANGING VOLUME BUTTON ON BOTH SIDES THAT WOULD CERTAINLY YIELD GREAT OPTIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0170713_0170940 'CAUSE IT COULD BE MADE ALL SYMMETRICAL AND STUFF
AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0171552_0171617 THAT IS TRUE

AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016630_0016914 THE MUTE BUTTON JUST BELOW THAT
AMI_TS3003d_H02_MTD0010ID_0016914_0017143 THEN THERE'S THE VOLUME AND CHANNEL SELECTORS
