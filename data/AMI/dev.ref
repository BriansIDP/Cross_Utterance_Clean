AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0092683_0093381 TO H HAVE SPEECH RECOGNITION PROGRAMMED IN EVERY SINGLE REMOTE MIGHT BE A LITTLE PRICEY
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0093381_0093500 YEAH
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0093500_0094279 RIGHT SO UM YEAH

AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0099861_0100595 SO DO YOU THINK EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SPEEK SPEECH RECOGNITION OUR TARGET GROUP SHOULD STILL BE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0100595_0100616 HUH
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0100772_0100830 OKAY

AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0107863_0108477 THEY'RE I MEAN ONE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FOR V. C. R. TYPE THING AND THE OTHER LOOKED LIKE JUST TELEVISION
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0108764_0108821 OH REALLY
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0108941_0109494 'CAUSE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHETHER WE WANT TO HAVE V. C. R. CAPABILITIES

AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0115972_0116418 LIKE IF YOU HOLD ONE DOWN IT'S IT'S A DIFFERENT COLOUR THAN THE OTHER BUTTONS BUT THAT TURNS IT ON
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0116418_0116758 SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A SEPARATE POWER BUTTON IT'S JUST
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0116844_0116873 BUT
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0117158_0117296 IT MIGHT BE CONFUSING
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0117296_0117334 YEAH

AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0147405_0147652 YOU KNOW ACTUALLY OUR OUR NEW PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0147652_0148398 I'M NOT SURE IF THEY MEANT O ONL USE ONLY FOR TELEVISION AS IN NOT FOR D. V. D. OR JUST NOT INTERNET TYPE THINGS
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0148398_0148955 SO I'LL I'LL CHECK THAT AND UPDATE YOU ON THE NEXT BUT WE'LL HOLD OFF ON THAT 'CAUSE
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0149029_0149136 BUT S YEAH UH
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0149432_0149473 YEAH

AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0151409_0151468 BUT I
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0151878_0151931 YEAH
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0154808_0155099 UM YEAH LET'S THINK ABOUT IT 'CAUSE WE NEED TO WRAP UP
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0155099_0155355 UM LET'S SEE
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0155355_0156275 UM SO EVERYONE'S GONNA GO FINISH THEIR QUESTIONNAIRE UH THEN WHEN WE COME BACK AFTER LUNCH WE'LL HAVE THIRTY MINUTES OF INDIVIDUAL WORK
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0156275_0157094 UM YEAH SO THINK ABOUT THE THINGS WE'VE DISCUSSED AND BRING SOME NEW IDEAS TO OUR NEXT MEETING
AMI_ES2011b_H00_FEE041_0157094_0157153 SEE YOU SOON
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0009530_0009588 JUST UH
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0012499_0012588 YOU MAY NEED TO
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0013574_0014277 BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO IT IT'S LIKE A THREE SET SETTING CYCLE SO PRESS IT A COUPLE TIMES HOLD DOWN FUNCTION AND THEN PRESS F. EIGHT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0016055_0016112 ADJUSTING
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0016576_0016799 THE CABLE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOOSE OR SOMETHING
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0016799_0016856 OH YOU GOT IT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0059358_0059553 HOW DO I UM
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0061140_0061166 RIGHT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0061436_0062109 OKAY SO THIS IS ON THE WORKING DESIGN WHICH IS SORT OF THE UH MECHANICAL FUNCTIONS OF THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0062109_0062704 UM AND THE METHOD I USED WAS TO BASICALLY LOOK AT EXISTING DESIGNS AND INCORPORATE IDEAS FROM OUR LAST MEETING
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0062810_0063392 UM SO I THINK WE NEED TWO BASIC FUNCTIONS WHICH IS JUST THE BASIC REMOTE FUNCTIONS
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0063392_0063880 THE USER CAN INPUT A CHANNEL OR VOLUME SETTING AND IT WILL BE OUTPUT TO THE T. V.
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0063880_0065024 AND ALSO WE TALKED ABOUT UM A LOCATION FUNCTION WHERE MAYBE YOU COULD PRESS A BUTTON ON THE T. V. AND IT WOULD SEND SORT OF SIGNAL TO THE REMOTE WHERE IT WOULD BEEP OR FLASH OR VIBRATE OR WHATEVER TO TELL YOU WHERE THE REMOTE IS
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0065200_0065830 SO THE COMPONENTS WE NEED ARE AN ENERGY SOURCE TO POWER THE REMOTE UM INPUT WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0065830_0066406 ALTHOUGH UM WE JUST TALKED ABOUT VOICE RECOGNITION PROCESSOR TO TAKE THE INFORMATION
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0066406_0067225 UM SOMETHING TO TRANSMIT IT TO THE T. V. AND WE ALSO NEED SOMETHING ON THE REMOTE THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE LOCATION SIGNAL AND HAVE AN OUTPUT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0067225_0067574 LIKE POSSIBLY A BEEP OR A VIBRATION
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0067574_0067801 AND ALSO YOU NEED A SENDER FOR LOCATION SIGNAL
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0067801_0068432 WHICH WOULD PROBABLY BE A SEPARATE UM THING THAT WE'D HAVE TO SELL WITH THE REMOTE AND PEOPLE COULD STICK IT ON THEIR T. V. OR STICK IT ON THEIR WALL
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0068677_0069035 AND THIS IS JUST SORT OF AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THE REMOTE WORKS
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0069035_0069286 POWER COMES FROM THE BATTERY GOES TO THE CHIP
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0069392_0070059 UM AND THEN IT IS SENT FROM THERE TO AN INFRARED BULB WHICH IS PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO SEND TO THE T. V.
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0070059_0070714 AND THEN FOR THE LOCATION FUNCTION YOU WOULD HAVE A SENDER ON THE T. V. WHICH WOULD OUTPUT SOME SORT OF SIGNAL
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0070714_0071132 UM WE COULD USE I. R. BUT WE'D PROBABLY WANNA USE RADIO INSTEAD
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0071132_0071858 THAT SIGNAL WOULD GO TO A RECEIVER WHICH IT WOULD PROCESS IT AND IT WOULD BE OUTPUT IN THE FORM OF A BUZZER OR A LIGHT LIGHTING UP
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0072177_0072743 UM SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES FOR HOW TO BUILD THE REMOTE WOULD PROBABLY BE UH BATTERY FOR THE ENERGY SOURCE
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0072743_0073267 THAT WAY YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PLUG IT IN UM A BUTTON PAD FOR INPUT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0073267_0073890 UM WE CAN PURCHASE A PRE MADE CHIP WHICH WILL HANDLE ALL THE PROCESSING STUFF I. R. TRANSMITTER TO COMMUNICATE TO THE T. V.
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0073890_0074320 THAT'S JUST SORT OF STANDARD UM SO MOST T. V. S HAVE AN I. R. RECEIVER
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0074320_0075283 PROBABLY A RADIO RECEIVER TO SEND OUT LOCATION FUNCTION AND TO RECEIVE IT AND I'D PROBABLY SAY A BUZZER FOR THE LOCATION FUNCTION ON THE REMOTE ITSELF
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0075283_0075422 SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0075819_0075833 MM
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0076021_0076303 YEAH UH I D I WAS AN ENGINEER BEFORE I CAME HERE
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0088887_0089007 IT'S EASY TO IMPLEMENT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0089358_0089413 LOCATOR
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0090279_0090321 WELL
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0090493_0090989 I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT BUT UH I MEAN SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REALLY HARD TO PROGRAMME
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0090989_0091397 AND ALSO IF THE T. V. IS ON IT'S MAKING SOUND AND THE PEOPLE ON THE T. V. ARE TALKING
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0091397_0091703 AND IF SOMEBODY SAYS LIKE ONE THEN THE T. V. 'S GONNA SWITCH ITSELF TO CHANNEL ONE
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0091703_0092067 OR IT SEEMS LIKE A SILLY I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU WOULD IMPLEMENT IT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0092481_0092790 IT'S A COOL IDEA BUT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0094441_0095047 WELL YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A BUTTON ON A T. V. OR ON YOUR WALL OR SOME PLACE SINCE THE T. V. ALREADY HAS POWER
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0095047_0095600 YEAH YOU CLICK THE BUTTON IT'S GONNA SEND OUT A SIGNAL AND I WAS THINKING I. R. IS LINE OF SIGHT
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0095600_0095985 SO UNLESS THE REMOTE IS LIKE ACTUALLY IN FRONT OF THE T. V. IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0095985_0096326 UM SO PROBABLY LIKE A RADIO SIGNAL LIKE ON A ON A CELL PHONE
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0096326_0096827 SENDS OUT A SIGNAL AND THEN THE THE REMOTE HEARS THE SIGNAL AND SO IT BEEPS PROBABLY
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0097215_0097841 IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD SEPARATELY BECAUSE IF THE SENDER'S ON THE REMOTE THEN YOU'D HAVE TO FIND THE REMOTE FIRST TO CLICK THE BUTTON TO FIND THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0098293_0098620 YEAH IT'D PROBABLY JUST STICK IT ON YOUR T. V. SO IF YOU NEED TO FIND THE REMOTE CLICK THE BUTTON

AMI_ES2011b_H01_FEE042_0105148_0105593 YOU JUST HAVE SOMEONE CALL IT AND IT STARTS RINGING SOMEWHERE AND THEN YOU CAN FIGURE OUT THAT IT'S IN THE COUCH OR WHEREVER

AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0016791_0016975 RIGHT HERE WE ARE
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0016975_0017059 WE'RE HERE
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0017059_0017205 OKAY UM
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0017205_0017739 IN ORDER TO SEE WHAT THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS WERE TO BE FOUND UM
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0017909_0019071 A HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE TESTED IN A USABILITY LABORATORY THROUGH JUST THEIR HABITS TO N KNOW THEIR HABITS WERE OBSERVED AND QUESTIONNAIRES WERE GIVEN OUT
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0019071_0019730 UM THE FINDINGS IN IN SOME CASES MATCHED WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0019730_0020807 CUSTOME CUSTOMERS AND USERS DON'T LIKE THE WAY REMOTE CONTROLS LOOK THEY DON'T LIKE THE WAY THEY FEEL THEY DON'T THINK THEY MATCH THEIR OPERATING BEHAVIOUR
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0020807_0021297 AND AN EXAMPLE IS WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE BUTTONS THEY ONLY USE TEN PER CENT OF THE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0021297_0022002 SO LATER ON THERE'S A STUDY OF THE BUTTONS THAT THEY USE MOST AND I THINK WE SHOULD DESIGN ACCORDING TO THESE BUTTONS
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0022002_0022180 EASY TO LOSE AND R. S. I.
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0022180_0022388 I DON'T KNOW WHAT R. S. I. MEANS
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0022388_0022814 UM THE PERSON THAT DID THE QUESTIONNAIRE OBVIOUSLY DID I DON'T HAVE A CLUE
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0022874_0023551 UM ACCORDING TO THE FREQUENCY OF USE AND THE RELEVANCE OF EACH BUTTONS
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0023551_0024123 I HAVE MADE A LIST OF THE BUTTONS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0024123_0024483 SO THE MOST IMPORTANT BUTTONS ARE THOSE TO DO WITH CHANNEL SELECTION
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0024483_0024916 THEY'RE USED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TIMES PER HOUR
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0024916_0025043 AND UM
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0025137_0025612 YEAH SO AND AND PEOPLE LIKE TO ZAP A LOT APPARENTLY SO THIS IS THE ORDER
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0025612_0026010 CHANNEL SELECTION TELETEXT VOLUME AND POWER
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0026010_0026714 THE OTHER ONES ARE THE SETTINGS AND THEY'RE USED LESS THAN YOU KNOW ZERO POINT EIGHT TO ZERO POINT FIVE TIMES PER HOUR
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0026714_0027311 AND THIS MEANS THAT I THINK WE CAN WE COULD HAVE LIKE A A BUTTON FOR ALL THE SETTINGS AND THEN JUST ONE
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0027311_0027872 AND THEN FROM THERE GO ON TO THE AUDIO ON THE SCREEN EITHER ON THE REMOTE OR ON THE TELEVISION
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0027872_0027933 UM
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0028007_0028648 ABOUT THE SCREEN AND SPEECH RECOGNITION SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE WILLING THAN OTHERS TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR THAT
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0028648_0029533 AND IF WE LOOK AT THE MARKET F PEOPLE FROM WELL FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD YEAR OLDS I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE THIS
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0029533_0030450 UM NINETY ONE TO SEVENTY SIX PERCENT OF PEOPLE IN THAT AGE RANGE ARE WILLING TO PAY MORE FOR THIS SORT OF PRODUCT
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0030450_0031152 WHILE PEOPLE THAT ARE ABOVE THIRTY FIVE YEARS OL UM YEARS OLD GO FROM THIRTY FIVE PERCENT TO EIGHT PERCENT
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0031152_0031714 SO PEOPLE THAT ARE SIXTY FIVE FOR EXAMPLE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY PAY FOR THIS SORT OF THING
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0031714_0032206 UM I DON'T I DON'T KNOW UM WHAT THE DECISION TO BE MADE IS
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0032206_0033136 BUT I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY DO BUY REMOTES M MORE ARE THOSE LIKE TEENAGERS AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND UM
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0033136_0033363 MOST LIKELY BUT WE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0033464_0033826 AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER UM
AMI_ES2011b_H03_FEE044_0034189_0034310 SHALL I WHAT DO I DO

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0016738_0017326 MOSTLY BY CONSULTING REMOTE CONTROL DIAGRAMS FROM THE INTERNET AND ALSO BY INCORPORATING DESIGN IDEAS FROM THE LAST PROJECT MEETING
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0017535_0018100 UM SO WE NEED SOME CUSTOM DESIGN PARTS AND OTHER PARTS WE'LL JUST USE STANDARD
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0018100_0018893 UM I ASSUME WE'LL BE CUSTOM DESIGNING OUR CASE PROBABLY A HARD PLASTIC OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL CASE TO PROTECT THE REMOTE AND THE LOCATOR
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0019016_0019304 AND WE'LL NEED TO CUSTOM DESI DESIGN A CIRCUIT BOARD
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0019304_0019992 BECAUSE THE CIRCUIT BOARD HAS TO TAKE THE BUTTON INPUT AND SEND IT TO THE OUTPUT SO YOU HAVE TO DESIGN THAT EACH TIME
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0019992_0020330 BUT ONCE WE COME UP WITH A DESIGN WE'LL SEND IT TO THE CIRCUIT PEOPLE AND THEY'LL JUST PRINT IT OUT
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0020439_0020937 UM STANDARD PARTS INCLUDE THE BUTTONS AND THE WHEELS UM THE IPOD STYLE WHEEL
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0020937_0021392 THE INFRARED L. E. D. IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE INCLUDED IN THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT COMES WITH IT
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0021392_0021671 UM WE NEED A RADIO SENDER AND RECEIVER THOSE ARE STANDARD
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0021671_0022218 AND AL WE ALSO NEED A BEEPER OR BUZZER OR OTHER SORT OF NOISE THING FOR LOCATING THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0022354_0022519 SO WE HAVE SOME MATERIAL OPTIONS
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0022519_0022914 UM WE CAN USE RUBBER PLASTIC WOOD OR TITANIUM
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0022914_0023518 UM I'D RECOMMEND AGAINST TITANIUM BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY BE USED IN THE FLAT CASES AND IT'S REALLY HEAVY
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0023518_0024099 UM AND THE RUBBER CASE REQUIRES RUBBER BUTTONS SO IF WE DEFINITELY WANT PLASTIC BUTTONS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A RUBBER CASE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0024383_0024514 AND HMM
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0024630_0024887 UH WELL WE CAN USE WOOD
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0024887_0025122 I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'D WANT TO
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0025122_0025723 UM AND ALSO WE SHOULD NOTE THAT IF WE WANT AN IPOD STYLE WHEEL BUTTON IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A M QU SLIGHTLY MORE EXPENSIVE CHIP
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0025723_0026218 WE CAN'T USE THE MINIMAL CHIP WE NEED THE NEXT HIGHER GRADE WHICH IS CALLED REGULAR
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0026218_0026477 I DON'T THINK IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0026594_0026843 SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE GOT ON DESIGN
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0056142_0056611 YOU NEED A SCREEN WITH MUSIC BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC SONG LIKE YOU KNOW THAT BAND OR WHATEVER
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0056611_0056841 WITH T. V. CHANNELS IT'S YOU KNOW ONE TWO THREE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0056841_0056907 SO
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0057700_0057755 YEAH
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0058519_0058546 YEAH
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0064371_0064401 YEAH
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0064714_0065022 MY FLATMATES ACTUALLY HAD ONE WITH A WHEEL AND IT IT DID SHOW UP ON THE T. V.
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0065655_0065893 THEY HAVE TO R WHEEL REALLY FAST
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0065893_0066242 BUT I THINK THE WHEEL GOES THROUGH LIKE A HUNDRED CHANNELS AT LEAST ON THEIRS
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0073979_0074314 IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE ACCORDING TO THE DESIGN PEOPLE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0074314_0074616 YOU HAVE TO GET A AN ADVANCED CHIP IF YOU WANNA HAVE A SCREEN IN
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0074616_0074964 WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE REGULAR CHIP WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE MINIMAL
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0076334_0076376 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0085093_0085121 YEAH

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0088274_0088420 SO WE JUST USED THE TOP PART
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0091343_0091451 YEAH

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0094918_0095297 I BELIEVE IT'S INS IT'S GOTTA BE INSIDE THE T. V. NOT INSIDE THE REMOTE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0095445_0095527 I'M NOT SURE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0095798_0095917 WELL THEY USUALLY ARE

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0097972_0098262 YEAH IT MOST OF THE ONES WE'VE HAD HAVE HAD THE MENU BUTTON
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0098262_0098692 'CAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE A BUTTON ACCESS TO LIKE CHANGE THE CONTRAST OR SOMETHING
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0098692_0098923 'CAUSE IT JUST DOESN'T COME UP EVERY DAY OR SOMETHING
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0100115_0100149 MM-HMM
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0101444_0101496 YEAH

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0106621_0107168 UM ONE OF YOUR ONE OF THE MATERIAL OPTIONS IS A SORT OF RUBBER THAT'S IN LIKE THOSE STRESS BALL THINGS
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0107168_0107348 SO THAT WOULD BE SPONGY
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0109235_0109320 YEAH I THINK IT COULD WORK
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0110411_0110810 DON'T THINK I'D WANT IT TO FEEL LIKE A BANANA
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0112689_0113461 YOU COULD DO LIKE THE COMPUTERS WHERE THEY HAVE LIKE THE GRAPEFRUIT APPLE MACHINE AND THEY HAVE LIKE THE BLUEBERRY LIKE ALL THE COLOURS ARE NAMED AFTER FRUITS
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0123747_0123792 OH

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0125407_0125664 SO YOU'RE HOLDING A SQUISHY BALL AND THEN IT HAS A
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0125925_0125957 MM-HMM

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0138179_0138421 I THINK THE BATTERIES WOULD HAVE TO GO RIGHT UNDER THE PLASTIC CASE
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0138559_0138785 ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE SWITCHING OUT THE SQUISHY PART
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0138785_0139195 THEN YOU NEED TO HAVE THE OTHER PART JUST BE SORT OF A SINGLE UNIT THAT YOU CAN SNAP OFF
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0141162_0141200 WELL I DUNNO
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0141200_0141532 YOU'D SPEND SO MUCH TIME LIKE SQUISHING IT TO YOUR OWN PERSONAL HAND

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0144471_0145165 UH WE ACTUALLY HAD AN OPTION OF BATTERIES SOLAR POWER AND UM A DYNAMO WHICH IS SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0145165_0145286 SOMETHING TO DO WITH TORCHES
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0146050_0146155 OH OKAY
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0146155_0146707 YEAH THE OTHER ONE WAS THE OTHER ONE WAS A KINETIC THING WHERE YOU'D BASICALLY HAVE TO WIND IT YOURSELF
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0146707_0146920 SO I SORT OF PICKED BATTERY
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0146920_0147487 WE COULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT DOING A WIND UP OR A DYNAMO OR A SOLAR POWER
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0147487_0147769 UM BUT I THINK SOLAR POWER'S NOT AVAILABLE WITH THE RUBBER CASE ANYWAYS
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0147868_0148350 IT IT SEEMS A LITTLE WEIRD FOR A LIVING ROOM ANYWAYS
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0150508_0150671 DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO ACTUALLY
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0150773_0151310 ALL IT SAID WAS IT GAVE SORT OF RELATIVE SOME CHIPS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHERS SORT OF THINGS

AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0151857_0152060 MOST OF THE STUFF IS PRETTY CHEAP THOUGH BOUGHT IN BULK
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0152060_0152248 SO I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MUCH OF A PROBLEM
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0152491_0152733 LIKE THE CHIP IS PROBABLY THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0153042_0153771 UM FOR THINGS LIKE REMOTE CONTROLS UM THEY STAMP OUT A CHIP CALCULATORS TOO I THINK
AMI_ES2011c_H01_FEE042_0153771_0154038 UM SO YOU CAN MASS PRODUCE 'EM PRETTY CHEAP

AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0031016_0031870 RIGHT UM I HAVE BEEN SEARCHING THE CURRENT TRENDS UM BOTH ON THE WEB AND VIA FASHION WATCHERS
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0031870_0032570 AND THE FINDINGS ARE THAT THE FIRST THING TO AIM FOR IS A FASHION UH FANCY LOOK AND FEEL
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0032570_0032658 UM
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0032658_0033185 NEXT COMES TECHNOLOGIC TECHNOLOGY AND THE INNOVATIONS TO DO WITH THAT
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0033185_0033437 AND TH LAST THING IS THE
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0033561_0033807 EASY TO USE UM FACTOR
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0033807_0034727 UM FANCY LOOK AND FEEL GOES FAR BEYOND THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE THING BUT I SUPPOSE THAT IS INCLUDED IN IN THE EASE OF USE
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0034727_0035528 UM OUR FASHION WATCHERS IN MILAN AND PARIS HAVE DECIDED WELL NOTICED
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0035528_0036697 THAT F THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE THEME IS THE IS THE CURRENT TREND AND AND THEREFORE UM WE NEED TO GO FOR THAT IF WE WANT
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0036697_0036957 YOU KNOW WH WHATEVER OUR MOTTO IS
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0036957_0037031 UM

AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0037311_0037465 THE FASHION IN ELECTRONICS
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0037465_0037884 SO WE WANT TO PUT THE FASHION ELECTRONICS WE NEED TO GO FRUIT AND VEGETABLES
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0037884_0038934 AND ALSO GO FOR A SPONGY FEEL SO THE THE QUESTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY WHATE IS INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0038934_0039548 AS TO THE MATERIAL SHOULD BE LIMITED TO I DON'T KNOW HOW SPONGY IT CAN BE SHOULD DISCUSS THIS TOGETHER
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0039548_0040052 I DON'T KNOW HOW SPONGY CAN BE ACHIEVED BUT APPARENTLY THAT'S THE WAY TO GO
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0040162_0040297 UM

AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0041245_0041802 I THINK I THINK PEOPLE LIKE TO HAVE A FRUIT INSTEAD OF A VEGETABLES IN THEIR SITTING ROOM
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0041802_0042328 UH THOSE ARE JUST SUGGESTIONS AND ALSO WE NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER THIS SHOULD BE PRINTED
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0042328_0043101 SO THAT STILL HAS TO DO WITH THE MATERIAL DISCUSS SHOULD WE PRINT THE FRUIT STUFF OR SHOULD THE ACTUAL REMOTE LOOK LIKE A FRUIT
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0043164_0043596 UM AND FINALLY AGAIN WITH THE SPONGY
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0043596_0044651 IT HAS TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE SO MAYBE AGAIN OUR INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER SHOULD LOOK INTO THAT OR FIND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT'S BETTER THAN MINE
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0044651_0045028 UM YEAH TO SUMMARISE THESE ARE THE POINTS THAT NEED TO BE
AMI_ES2011c_H03_FEE044_0045133_0046103 UM TOUCHED IN ORDER TO GET A GOOD DECISION AND HOPEFULLY OUR USER INTERFACE HAS MORE TO SAY ABOUT THE MATTER

AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0013287_0013475 SO OUR DESIGN LOOKS SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0013577_0014034 THIS BEING THE WHEEL THAT YOU USE TO UH CHANGE CHANNELS OR VOLUME OR WHATEVER
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0014034_0014732 THIS IS A BUTTON SERVES AS THE POWER BUTTON IF YOU HOLD IT DOWN AND IF YOU JUST TAP ON IT I THINK IT BRINGS UP THE MENU
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0014882_0015494 AND UH THE BASE OF THE REMOTE CONTROL WHICH HAS A SQUISHY SPONGY RUBBERY FEEL IS INTERCHANGEABLE

AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0018189_0018868 SO WE'LL COME UP WITH A VARIETY OF TRENDY AND EXCITING FRUIT DESIGNS FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0018974_0019337 AND THEN PEOPLE WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO BUY THREE OR FIVE OF THEM BECAUSE THEY'LL NEED TO SWITCH 'EM OUT

AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0095117_0095180 ONE
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0095892_0095984 UH TWO

AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0110534_0110733 I THINK THE WHEEL WOULD PROBABLY BE MM
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0111408_0111733 I THINK THE BASE WOULD DEFINITELY BE LARGER 'CAUSE SOME OF THESE ARE NOT AS EASY TO HOLD
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0111733_0111940 THEY'RE KINDA SMALLISH
AMI_ES2011d_H01_FEE042_0112564_0112607 YEAH

AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0076661_0077226 ONE POINT I CAN SAY BY EXPERIENCE IT'S REALLY HARD TO SHARE AN OFFICE WITH THREE PEOPLE
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0077226_0077699 BECAUSE IT MAKES MUCH MORE NOISE THAT ONLY BEING TWO IN AN OFFICE
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0077908_0078043 PLUS THE COMPUTERS
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0078043_0078089 SO

AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0078505_0079564 SO WE MIGHT BE IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO FIRST EXCLUDE ONE OF THE THREE PERSON ROOM TO BE THE READING ROOM AND NOT TO BE NECESSARY
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0079675_0079944 A ROOM WITH THREE PEOPLE
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0079944_0080045 A WORKING ROOM

AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0085367_0085483 BUT AVOIDING
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0085650_0086158 HAVING THREE PERSON FULL TIME IN A SAME ROOM COULD BE A GOOD IDEA I THINK

AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0174301_0174345 YEAH YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0174573_0174608 OKAY
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0174728_0174855 SO LET'S HAVE A BREAK
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0174855_0174947 SAVE YOUR FILE
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0175431_0175518 YOU HAVE X. P.
AMI_IB4001_H00_MIO092_0175767_0175830 THAT'S NICE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0000781_0000919 OKAY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0000919_0001249 SO AS YOU GUYS KNOW F ISSCO IS TOO SMALL
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0001249_0001434 WELL THE BUILDING IS TOO SMALL FOR OUR GROUP
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0001434_0001667 SO WE'RE MOVING TO A NEW BUILDING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0001667_0001880 UH IT'S GONNA BE THE BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0001880_0002168 AND WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING IN THREE WEEKS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0002168_0003095 BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO KNOW WHO IS GOING TO BE IN WHAT OFFICE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND WHERE WE'RE G WE'RE GONNA PUT THINGS LIKE THE PRINTER
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0003095_0003383 THE FAX MACHINE ALL THE BIG EQUIPMENT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0003383_0003882 AND THE CATCH IS THAT THEY HAVE THE FINAL APPROVAL OF WHERE WE PUT PEOPLE AND EQUIPMENT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0003882_0004217 AND THEY WANT TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE GONNA DO ALL THIS BY NOVEMBER SECOND
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0004291_0004752 SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY NEXT TUESDAY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0004752_0005235 AND SINCE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY OTHER TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS TODAY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0005235_0005900 WHAT WE'RE GETTING IS NINE ROOMS FOR A MAXIMUM OF EIGHTEEN PEOPLE WHICH IS OKAY 'CAUSE THERE'S ONLY FIFTEEN OF US
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0005900_0006378 AND ALL THE ROOMS HAVE WINDOWS LUCKILY SO THERE'S NO FIGHTS ABOUT WHO GETS A WINDOW AND WHO DOESN'T
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0006378_0006859 UM THERE'S TWO VIEWS EITHER OF THE OLD TOWN OR THE MOUNTAINS AND THE ROOMS HAVE VARIOUS SIZES
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0006859_0007298 THERE'S TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOMS FIVE TWO PERSON ROOMS WHICH ARE ON THE CORNERS OF THE BUILDING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0007298_0007786 SO YOU ACTUALLY GET WINDOWS ON TWO WALLS AND TWO ONE PERSON ROOMS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0007861_0008094 THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHAT THE BUILDING LOOKS LIKE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0008094_0008441 UM AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PER ROOM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0008441_0009128 THE COURTYARD BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SIXTH FLOOR YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY GO OUT TO IT BUT IT JUST MEANS THAT THE WINDOWS LOOK OUT ONTO OPEN SPACE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0009128_0009724 UM YOU CAN SEE THE BATHROOMS THE ELEVATORS ARE SORT OF FURTHER DOWN THE HALL
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0009724_0010314 THE PURPLE BAR AT THE BOTTOM SORT OF ON THE RIGHT IS THE MAIL BOXES
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0010314_0011053 ALL OF THE WINDOWS OPEN YOU CAN GET OUT ONTO THE TERRACE JUST LIKE WE CAN IN OUR NORMAL BUILDING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0011053_0011612 AND THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE HAVE TO PUT SOMEWHERE ARE LIKE I SAID THE PHOTOCOPIER WHICH IS REALLY BIG
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0011612_0012169 THE FAX MACHINE WHICH IS NOT SO BIG AND THE PRINTER WHICH IS RELATIVELY BIG
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0012224_0012612 EACH OFFICE HAS A WHITE BOARD A BULLETIN BOARD AND A COAT RACK
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0012612_0013332 NO CUPBOARDS LIKE WE HAVE IN THE CURRENT OFFICES AND EACH PERSON GETS THEIR OWN CHAIR THEIR OWN CORNER DESK
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0013332_0013791 SO LIKE THE N THE ONES THAT WE HAVE NOW UM A SMALL FILING CABINET WITH THREE DRAWERS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0013791_0014272 AND BY SMALL I MEAN THEY'RE ABOUT THAT TALL AND ONE SORT OF HANGING SHELF
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0014272_0014691 SO WE DON'T GET THE BOOKCASES LIKE WE HAVE NOW BUT JUST ONE SHELF THAT'S ATTACHED TO THE WALL
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0014841_0015801 AND THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE TO PLACE UH YOU CAN SEE THE LIST THERE ALONG WITH THEIR POSITION AND THE PROJECT THAT THEY WORK ON
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0015801_0016321 AND I GUESS THE QUESTION THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW WE WANT TO ORGANISE PEOPLE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0016321_0016883 WHETHER WE WANT TO DO IT BY RANK OR BY PROJECT OR
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0017075_0017699 I DON'T KNOW PUT ALL THE P. H. D. STUDENTS TOGETHER ALL THE PROFESSORS TOGETHER THAT SORT OF THING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0017699_0018071 SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE COME UP WITH A PLAN
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0018071_0018549 THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP WHO'S GONNA BE WORKING ON THE SAME PLAN LATER THIS WEEK
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0018549_0019356 AND THEN ANDRE AND I HAVE TO DO PRESENTATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS ON THE SECOND
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0019356_0019808 SO WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN POSSIBLY IF WE HAVE TIME A PRESENTATION
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0019808_0020305 A QUICK PRESENTATION WITH ARGUMENTS FOR WHY WE THINK OUR PLAN WORKS BEST
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0020305_0020349 OKAY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0020590_0021121 SO ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS OR
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0021284_0021340 I GUESS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0022680_0022748 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0022748_0023274 UM I THINK IT'S THE SECURITY IS SORT OF THE SAME AS IT IS IN THE CURRENT BUILDING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0023274_0023877 SO AS LONG AS THE THINGS ARE PHYSICALLY ATTACHED TO THE WALL SO THEY CAN'T BE REMOVED THEN IT SHOULD BE OKAY TO LEAVE THEM IN THE HALL
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0024328_0024723 IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHETHER YOU ARE PRINTING SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS OR N WHATEVER
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0025248_0026070 UM WELL WE GET ONE SORT OF NETWORKED PRINTER AND THEN I THINK SOME OF US HAVE PERSONAL PRINTERS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0026070_0026474 I THINK SUSAN HAS A PERSONAL PRINTER GISELLA HAS ONE MAYBE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0026589_0026718 I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO ELSE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0026718_0026737 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0026737_0027035 BUT NO ONE ELSE GETS THEIR OWN PRINTER
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0027035_0027318 IN TERMS OF EQUIPMENT IT'S SORT OF THE SAME THING AS WE HAVE NOW
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0027767_0027819 UM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0028288_0028877 SO WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS THAT WE SORT OF DISCUSS VARIOUS CONCEPTS WITHOUT GETTING INTO SPECIFICS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0028877_0029483 AND THEN GO OFF AND THINK ABOUT IT OVER LUNCH AND THEN COME BACK LATER IN THE DAY WITH SORT OF MORE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0029483_0029745 AS TO EXACTLY WHERE TO PUT PEOPLE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0029908_0030132 DOES THAT WORK
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0030132_0031019 OH AND ON THE MAP THE LITTLE HALF CIRCULAR WELL QUATER CIRCLES ARE DOORS WHICH I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE FIGURED OUT BUT JUST IN CASE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0031019_0031625 AND THERE'S JUST THE ONE ROOM THAT ACTUALLY HAS TWO DOORS GOING INTO IT THE THE THREE PERSON ROOM ON THE RIGHT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0031625_0031657 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0031974_0032083 YES YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0032083_0032413 A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE A READING ROOM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0032545_0032930 SO WE SHOULD LEAVE A SPACE FOR THAT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0032930_0033428 AND WE CAN BECAUSE LIKE I SAID MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN PEOPLE IN THOSE ROOMS AND THERE IS ONLY FIFTEEN OF US
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0033428_0034061 AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE NOTICED BUT TWO OF US ARE ONLY HERE HALF THE TIME
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0034061_0034593 SO MARTIN AND DAVID UM ARE HALF THE TIME AT THE E. P. F. L. AND HALF THE TIME IN GENEVA
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0034593_0034642 SO
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0034868_0035158 SORT OF KEEP THAT IN MIND I GUESS WHEN

AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0047792_0048145 YEAH YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE TO PUT THE FAX IN THERE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0048310_0048431 UH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0048615_0048797 SO
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0052509_0052541 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0053982_0054005 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0054277_0054954 WELL THE THIRD OPTION IS JUST COMPLETELY MIX EVERYONE UP WHICH SOME PEOPLE SAY IS BETTER SORT OF FOR A GROUP ENVIRONMENT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0054954_0055354 SO THAT YOU ARE NOT STUCK ONLY WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON YOUR PROJECT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0055354_0055372 RIGHT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0055372_0055828 SO IF YOU SHARE AN OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHO'S ON A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROJECT YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THAT PROJECT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0055828_0056171 BUT YOU ALSO SORT OF INTERACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0058383_0058427 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0059055_0059614 I THINK IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF RESERVING IT BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER ROOMS AT THE UNIVERSITY THAT YOU CAN RESERVE FOR A MEETING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0059614_0059880 BUT IF IT'S EMPTY THEN SURE YOU CAN USE IT FOR A MEETING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0059880_0059988 THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0059988_0060595 BUT I THINK IF SOMEONE'S ALREADY READING IN THERE IT'S NOT FAIR TO GO AND KICK THEM OUT JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO HAVE A MEETING 'CAUSE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0061907_0062138 BUT IF YOU'RE HAVING A SHORT MEETING YOU DON'T REALLY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0062282_0062402 MAKE AN APPOINTMENT FOR IT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0062402_0062875 YOU JUST KIND OF GO TO SOMEONE'S OFFICE AND GO DOWN FOR A COFFEE OR WHATEVER
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0063130_0063478 'CAUSE THERE'S STILL THE CAFETERIAS THAT YOU CAN USE FOR INFORMAL
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0064250_0064276 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0064911_0064940 MM-HMM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0065396_0065459 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0065459_0065670 AND THE OTHER MARIANNE TOO
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0065670_0065779 SO THERE'S THREE OF YOU
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0066434_0066956 WELL BUT THEN YOU EITHER SHARE OFFICES WITH EACH OTHER WHICH DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0066956_0067297 BECAUSE CHANCES ARE YOU ARE NOT GONNA HAVE OFFICE HOURS AT THE EXACT SAME TIME
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0067416_0067680 SO YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0067812_0068577 LIKE UNLESS YOU GET INDIVIDUAL OFFICES I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN EASY WAY TO FIND A SOLUTION FOR THAT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0069021_0069485 'CAUSE EVEN IF EACH OF YOU SHARE WITH A PROFESSOR THEN IT'S THE SAME THING FOR THE PROFESSOR
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0069892_0070034 BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0070271_0071093 UNLESS YOU END UP SHARING AN OFFICE WITH SOMEONE WHERE YOUR SCHEDULES COMPLETELY DON'T OVERLAP AND THEN YOU CAN SCHEDULE OFFICE HOURS WHEN THE OTHER PERSON ISN'T THERE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0071093_0071386 SOME PEOPLE COME IN AROUND ELEVEN AND SOME PEOPLE COME IN AROUND EIGHT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0071878_0071915 NO
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0072169_0072351 NO BUT YOU SORT OF SEE PEOPLE'S PATTERNS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0072351_0072402 I MEAN
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0072541_0073123 EVEN IF IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THAT I MEAN IF IT'S LIKE THAT YOU KNOW EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE TIME THEN
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0073375_0073688 BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WE CAN'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS TOO MUCH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0075529_0075580 I THINK
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0075778_0076185 WELL IT'S UP TO US HOW WE DO IT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0076185_0076405 I CAN SEE BENEFITS OF BOTH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0076574_0076598 BUT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0077790_0077808 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0077808_0077911 PLUS THE COMPUTERS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0078081_0078441 AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE FIVE COMPUTERS IN YOUR OFFICE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0081565_0081982 YEAH THAT'S A GOOD POINT BECAUSE IF WE TAKE THE THREE PERSON ROOM OUT AS A READING ROOM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0082096_0082391 THEN EVERYONE HAS AN OFFICE RIGHT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0082391_0082535 'CAUSE IT'S MAXIMUM EIGHTEEN
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0082679_0083199 SO TAKE AWAY THREE SPACES AND YOU'RE DOWN TO YOUR FIFTEEN AND YOU'RE RIGHT IF WE DO HAVE A STAGIEUR WHOEVER
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0083199_0083771 WHO COMES IN THEN WE HAVE NOWHERE WELL WE CAN PUT THEM IN THE READING ROOM BUT THAT KIND OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0084770_0084796 MM-HMM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0085066_0085104 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0085967_0086002 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0086202_0086597 OR AGAIN FIND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WORK THE SAME HOURS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0086726_0086964 IT DOESN'T COMPLETELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0087824_0087884 YEAH I THINK SO
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0088023_0088195 A ONE PERSON'LL BE TOO SMALL ANYWAYS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0088444_0088545 THE ONE ON THE BOTTOM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0088740_0088765 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0089104_0089232 TWO
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0089232_0089534 WELL WHICH W THERE'S THREE TWO PERSON ROOMS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0089781_0089887 THAT HAS TWO WINDOWS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0090040_0090133 WHICH IS FINE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0090133_0090271 AND STILL A BIG ROOM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0090866_0091109 YEAH SO I SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED THAT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0091810_0091957 YEAH BUT THEN YOU GET DON'T GET A LOT OF LIGHT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0092114_0092166 FOR READING
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0092414_0092768 REALLY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0093470_0093538 THAT'S
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0093900_0094099 I DUNNO I LIKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING OUT OVER
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0094225_0094386 LOTS OF SPACE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0094593_0094789 WELL I MEAN THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT RIGHT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0094789_0095533 IT'S JUST SOMEWHERE TO GET OUT OF YOUR OFFICE AND GO AND DO SOMETHING ELSE FOR A WHILE WHETHER YOU'RE READING OR JUST KIND OF STARING OFF INTO SPACE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0096504_0096605 YEAH WE COULD DO THAT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0097037_0097070 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0097930_0098386 WE HAVE SOME SHELVES LIKE CABINET TYPE SHELVES FOR THE READING ROOM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0098386_0098615 BUT IT'S NOT REALLY INTENDED TO BE A LIBRARY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0098615_0098681 I MEAN WE HAVE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0098828_0099031 AN I. T. LIBRARY
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0099031_0099151 UM BUT
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0099325_0099729 THE OTHER IDEA IS TO TAKE 'CAUSE RIGHT NOW WE ALL HAVE BOOKSHELVES
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0099729_0100405 SO ONE IDEA MIGHT BE TO TAKE SORT OF THE BOOKS THAT AREN'T FREQUENTLY USED BY PEOPLE PUT THEM ALL INTO THAT ROOM
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0100405_0100517 SO IT BECOMES SORT OF
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0100645_0101235 A MINI LIBRARY BUT NOT LIKE A LIBRARY SYSTEM LIBRARY JUST GO AND BORROW YOUR COLLEGUES' BOOKS
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0102939_0103034 I THINK THE MIDDLE ONE
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0103182_0103245 YEAH
AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0103245_0103814 IT'S ALSO SORT OF M CENTRAL TO THE LAYOUT SO EVERYONE SORT OF HAS MORE OR LESS THE SAME DISTANCE TO

AMI_IB4001_H01_FIE038_0104255_0104308 WHY NOT

AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0021879_0022594 SO I'M NOT REALLY SURE IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET THREE UM THREE DESKS IN A TWO PERSON OFFICE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0022594_0022841 BUT UM WE COULD TRY
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0022841_0023678 WHAT'S WHAT SHOULD BE SAID HERE I DON'T KNOW IF WELL YOU I I WILL MAYBE DISTRIBUTE NOW DOCUMENTS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM

AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0025262_0025833 UH AS YOU KNOW SOME OF US AND SOME OF YOU HERE ACTUALLY MARTIN AND DAVID ARE PART TIME
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0025833_0026114 SO IT IT'S FOR THE MOMENT QUITE COMFORTABLE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0026114_0026960 NORMALLY WE SHOULD EVEN GET AN EXTRA UH AN EXTRA PLACE FOR YOU KNOW TEMPORARY PEOPLE COMING TO WORK ON UH ON PROJECTS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0026960_0027977 UH YEAH I UH YEAH I COUNTED SO WE HAVE UM FIFTEEN PERS PHYSICAL PERSONS AND ABOUT UH SIXTEEN
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0027977_0028444 I THINK UH PERSONS OH ACTUALLY EIGHTEEN PERSONS IN THE OFFICES
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0028698_0029382 EXACTLY IT SO ONE OF THE ISSUES UH HERE IT'S PROBABLY NOT ON THE SLIDES IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE UH
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0029382_0029992 UNLIKE WHAT HAD UNTIL NOW A LOUNGE OR READING ROOM UH IN ONE OF THE THE OFFICES
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0029992_0030114 SO IN ONE OF THE ROOMS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0030329_0030726 UM I THINK QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE E EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR THAT
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0030726_0031167 SO IF WE COULD DO IT THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH NICER
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0031167_0031533 UM LET ME ALSO UH ST SAY SOMETHING YEP
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0032343_0032545 YEAH I I THINK SO

AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0034636_0034833 SO IT'S STILL SHOULD BE FEASIBLE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0034946_0035019 THAT'S
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0035242_0035526 YEAH I THINK THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT TO MANAGE SOME SPACE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0035526_0036066 MAYBE WE CAN THINK OF YEAH SOME TWO OR THREE YEAH FOR VISITING PEOPLE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0036066_0036115 CORRECT
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0036286_0036392 MM-HMM
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0036392_0036820 OKAY SO LET ME FINISH WITH THE THE CONSTRAINTS WHICH ARE ALMOST DONE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0036820_0037407 SO WE ALSO NEED TO TO FIND THE A SPOT FOR THE PHOTOCOPIER THE FAX MACHINE AND THE PRINTER
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0037407_0038186 THE FAX YOU KNOW IS VERY SMALL BUT UM THE PHOTOCOPIER IS QUITE HUGE AND THE PRINTER IS UH WELL AB THIS SIZE

AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0038508_0038714 NOT VERY UH VERY IMPORTANT
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0038714_0039340 UH THE FURNITURE THAT W EACH EACH PERSON HAS AND UH YOU HAVE A LIST OF PEOPLE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0039473_0040332 SO THE THING UH YOU YOU OUGHT TO KNOW IS THAT WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT W WE'RE THIN THAT THAT ARE THINKING ABOUT UH FOR WELL
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0040332_0040571 ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE I IN THESE ROOMS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0040571_0040932 UM THERE IS ANOTHER GROUP THAT IS ALSO HAVING DISCUSSIONS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0040932_0042167 SO THE IDEA IS THAT TODAY WE'LL JUST TRY TO F START SEEING THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS AND THEN YOU HAVE TIME TO TO GO AND THINK ABOUT IT UH ASK THE PEOPLE YOU KNOW
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0042167_0042799 YOUR ASSISTANTS FOR INSTANCE AND AT THE NEXT MEETING WE'LL TRY TO TO COME WITH ONE SOLUTION
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0042799_0043308 UH THE OTHER GROUP WILL ALSO PROPOSE A SOLUTION AND THEN THERE WILL BE ANOTHER NEGOTIATION
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0043308_0043378 SO W
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0043736_0044011 UH IF I IF WE DON'T GET THESE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0044011_0044950 UM WELL BASICALLY THEY ARE PROMISED TO US SO UH DO DO YOU THINK THERE ARE CHANCES THAT THEY TAKE FROM US ONE OF THE ROOMS OR UH
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0045097_0045481 YEAH I I I THINK IT'S UH UH YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0045698_0045932 YEAH I YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE THE PROBLEMS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0045932_0046830 I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAYBE THINK OF SOME OF THE BIGGER ROOMS WITH FOUR PEOPLE ONE BEING TEMPORARY OR OR PART TIME
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0046830_0047679 UM OKAY SO MAYBE WE COULD TRY TO TO SEE NOW WHAT WOULD BE THE MAIN OPTIONS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0047679_0048073 SAY THE GENERAL UH WELL ARRANGEMENT OPTIONS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0048073_0048671 DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD PUT PEOPLE SAY ACCORDING TO PROJECTS FOR INSTANCE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0048671_0049569 IN IN THE TABLE THAT UM THAT WE HAVE UH WE ALSO HAVE THE UH UH THE P THE MAIN PROJECTS ON WHICH THE PEOPLE ARE WORKING
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0049569_0049836 SO HOW YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0049836_0049864 MM-HMM
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0052291_0052704 OH ACTUALLY WHAT IS FIXED IS THE N THE NUMBER OF ROOMS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0052704_0052861 THIS WE CANNOT REALLY CHANGE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0052861_0053451 I MEAN AT LEAST NOT US IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET ANOTHER ANOTHER ROOM FOR INSTANCE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0053451_0053991 BUT WHAT IS ABSOLUTELY N NOT FIXED IS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOMS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0053991_0054412 SO BASICALLY WE ARE ALL THE PERMUTATIONS ARE POSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0055180_0055228 UM
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0055541_0056146 WELL WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IS A SOLUTION THAT SUITS EVERYONE AND THAT MAKES THE MAXIMUM OF PEOPLE HAPPY
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0056146_0056929 SO UH THE OTHER GROUP IS UH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO SEE THEM AS COMPETITORS BUT THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO TO FIND ANOTHER LOCAL OPTIMUM
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0056929_0057030 OR L UH
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0057490_0057545 UH
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0058204_0058327 YEAH

AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0058451_0058797 I I THINK THAT'S YEAH THERE IS NO REAL COMPETITION BETWEEN THE TWO
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0058797_0059375 BUT WE'LL JUST TRY TO FIND AT LEAST TWO SOLUTIONS AND SEE HOW HOW CLOSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0059375_0060080 IT'S IT'S I THINK WELL THE M THE PEOPLE WHO WHO DECIDED THIS THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST SOLUTION TO
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0060080_0060454 MM WELL YOU KNOW FIND TWO TWO KINDS OF OPINIONS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0060454_0060521 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0060521_0061036 WELL WE COULD HAVE BEEN EIGHT H SITTING AROUND HERE AND AND TALKING BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S MORE DIFFICULT

AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0062836_0063203 EXACTLY I THINK SO SO TODAY THE GOAL IS NOT TO TO FIND THE SOLUTION TODAY
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0063203_0063883 BUT TO SET SOME CONSTRAINTS AND THEN GO AND SEE THE PEOPLE AND FIND OUT IF THEY HAVE ANY PREFERENCES
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0063883_0064537 OBVIOUSLY WE WON'T BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THE THE PREFERENCES BUT AT LEAST WE'LL FIND THE MOST UH THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0064675_0064759 P S I THINK

AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0065652_0066039 YEAH I THINK SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE STUDENTS
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0066039_0066367 WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY IF THEY PREFER FOR INSTANCE TO BE ALONE
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0066367_0067048 OR TO WELL TO BE WITH THEIR ASSISTANT OR EVEN WITH ANOTHER PERSON WORKING ON THE PROJECT
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0067048_0067700 SO THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE YEAH ANOTHER SOLUTION IS TO ASK EVERYONE TO PROVIDE UH AN ARRANGEMENT
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0067700_0068189 BUT UH I THINK THAT'S A BIT UH A BIT HARD THEN TO TO WORK OUT
AMI_IB4003_H00_MIO036_0068189_0068936 UM SO SINCE ALL OF YOU HAVE A COPY OF THE UH WELL OF THE DRAWING I THINK FOR THE NEXT TIME

AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0105448_0105517 THEY WILL CHANGE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0105643_0106234 THAT'S WHAT THE ONLY THING THAT WILL NOT OR THAT WILL CHANGE ONLY PROGRESSIVELY IN TIME IS THE STATUS OF THE PEOPLE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0106234_0106265 MM
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0106611_0106795 YEAH THEY WILL PROMOTE THAT
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0106884_0107133 BUT STILL TH SOME THINGS WELL YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0107633_0107654 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0109351_0109872 IF IF IT IF I IF PROJECTS ARE WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND I THINK THAT UH MEETING ROOM IS THE THE TOOL FOR THAT
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0109872_0110140 IF YOU NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE IN A PROJECTS TALKING TOGETHER
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0110140_0110574 THEY JUST HAVE A MEETING ROOM IF IT'S NOT TOO FAR AWAY THEN THEN IT'S A VERY GOOD GOOD PRACTICE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0111111_0111135 YES
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0111382_0112263 THAT'S WHY I WAS QUITE RECEPTIVE TO UH SUSAN'S REMARK AT THE BEGINNING IS I WOULDN'T FORMULATE IT IN A SUCH A AN EXTREME WAY AS

AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0112415_0112726 BUT UH I WOULD P PROBABLY FORMULATE IT IN THE WAY THAT UH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0112726_0113234 DO WE WANT TO HAVE ONLY A LOUNGE OR S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED ONLY AS A READING ROOM
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0113343_0113817 BECAUSE BECAUSE MEETING ROOMS TO ME ARE VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS TO DO UH COLLABORATIVE WORK
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0113934_0114171 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WE ALSO HAVE TO RELAX SO THAT'S
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0114583_0114622 YES
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0114836_0114872 YES
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0115541_0115564 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0115967_0116822 'CAUSE THAT'S REALLY MY ONE OF MY WORRIES WITH THE PLAN THAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT IT'S IT PR PROVIDES NO POSSIBLE POSSIBILITIES OF EXPANSION
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0116925_0117000 AND THIS WILL HAPPEN
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0117000_0117271 I MEAN YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T PREVENT HAVING VISITORS
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0117271_0117354 AND YOU SHOULDN'T
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0117904_0118150 WHICH FOR FOR FIFTEEN PEOPLE IT'S NOT ENOUGH

AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0120892_0121170 BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY RELATED WITH SECURITY UH REGULATION AS WELL
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0121170_0121708 I MEAN YOU CAN'T JUST PUT WALLS IN IN ROOMS WITHOUT ANY SPECIFIC AUTHORIS YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0121708_0121945 UH IT'S NOT NECESSARY HEAVY IN TERMS OF WORK
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0121945_0122202 IT'S HEAVY IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORISATION
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0122348_0122417 AT LEAST AT E. P. F. L.
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0123420_0123471 I THINK SO
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0123471_0123876 IF YOU ORGANISE THE DESKS IN A IN A INTELLIGENT WAY
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0124253_0124294 YEP

AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0125624_0125640 NO
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0126242_0126403 COFFEE MACHINES ARE THAT MADE FOR THAT
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0127475_0127867 NO THAT'S THAT'S PROXIMITY DOESN'T PLAY A BIG ROLE THERE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0127867_0128317 WE CAN DISCUSS WITH PEOPLE THAT THE THE SPACE IS VERY SMALL I MEAN ALTOGETHER IT'S
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0128448_0129077 AND UH YOU DON'T Y YOU DON'T NEED TO DISCUSS ABOUT THE PROJECTS YOU F MORE NEED ABOUT TH TO DISCUSS ABOUT WHERE IS THE PRINTER

AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0129763_0129905 THIS IS NOT PROJECT RELATED
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0131152_0131182 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0133719_0133775 YEAH THAT'S TRUE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0135727_0135852 IT'S NON SMOKING CAMPUS
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0136287_0136492 NOT EVEN IN THE CAFETERIA
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0136492_0136543 DOWNSTAIRS
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0136683_0136715 OKAY
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0136791_0136816 WOW
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0136828_0137112 ON THE ROOF MAYBE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0137362_0137441 THE BALCONY OKAY
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0137682_0137794 BUT ANDRE UH JUST A
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0138496_0138772 STILL SOME PLACES WHERE SMOKERS CAN SURVIVE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0138772_0139082 BUT ANDRE JUST A COMMENT ABOU ABOUT YOUR YOUR PREVIOUS UH REQUEST
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0139082_0139567 I I DON'T THINK THAT ANYONE WILL PROVIDE YOU INFORMATION SUCH AS WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE WITH WHOM
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0139567_0140097 THAT'S A TYPICAL UH OUTPUT OF EX UH RESEARCH IN EXPERT SYSTEMS
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0140097_0140247 THESE ARE THE RULES THAT YOU NEVER GET
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0140247_0140529 BUT UH YOU CAN GET THEM THROUGH A PROPOSAL
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0140529_0140772 SO YOU PROPOSE A SET UP
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0140772_0141472 WHERE PEOPLE ARE WITH OTHER PEOPLES AND THEY WILL FIND POLITICALLY CORRECT WAYS TO TELL YOU THAT UH THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A VIEW ON THE MOUNTAINS
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0141472_0141968 BUT THEY PREFER TO HAVE VIEW ON THE OLD TOWN SO THEY WOULD BE IN THE TOILETS
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0141968_0142212 THEY WOULD UM P PREFER TO BE IN ANOTHER ROOM
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0142681_0142702 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0142817_0142843 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0142941_0143307 BUT THAT'S A SEC S THAT'S THE ADMIN THAT'S THE ADMIN UH SO IT'S PART OF THE WORK
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0143307_0143322 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0144271_0144390 AND THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM YOU'RE RIGHT
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0144390_0145226 BECAUSE BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A ONE PERSON WE D WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR UH ACCOMMODATING THE UH THE ADMIN PLACE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0145226_0145851 AND UH IF YOU PUT TWO PERSON PERSONS OR THREE PERSONS FOR THE ADMIN SPACE WHO WHO WHO ELSE WOULD YOU PUT IN THERE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0145976_0147015 BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY ASSISTANT MANAGER OR WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE ONLY ONE HALF PART HALF TIME UH ADMIN AND NO OTHER NON RESEARCHER POSITIONS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0147015_0147198 AND THIS IS REALLY A PIECE OF A PROBLEM
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0147198_0147393 MAYBE YOU COULD PUT SOME VISITORS BUT UM
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0147511_0147553 I KNOW
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0147553_0147902 IT'S NOT VERY UH REALISTIC IN A IN A IN AN ADMIN ROOM BUT UH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0148648_0148794 YEAH BECAUSE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0148805_0148967 YOU CAN'T PUT A RESEARCHER THERE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0148967_0149454 THAT'S JUST EITHER YOU LOSE ONE POSITION OR YOU FIND ANOTHER ADMIN OR ASSISTANT MANAGER
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0150020_0150037 YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0151373_0151388 YEP
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0152975_0153120 NO THAT'S NOT SURE THAT'S NOT SURE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0153120_0153952 UH THE THERE ARE TO ME THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS POSSIBLE IS EITHER YOU WE CAN TAKE ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR THE ADMIN
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0153952_0154544 BECAUSE SOME OF TYPICALLY THE PROFESSORS HAVE GOOD REASONS FOR SHARING
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0154544_0155184 SHARING EITHER WITH A COLLEAGUE OR SHARING UH WITH SOME OF THEIR UH ONE OF THEIR P. H. D. STUDENTS
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0155184_0155334 IN THAT CASE IT'S IT'S REALISTIC
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0155334_0155921 THEN WE COULD VERY VERY SIMPLY UH ALLOCATE THE ONE PERS ONE OF THE ONE PERSON ROOMS FOR THE ADMIN
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0155921_0156105 AND THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0156105_0156360 THE OTHER THING IS TO TAKE A TWO PERSON ROOM FOR THE ADMIN
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0156360_0157042 THAT COULD BE THE ONE UH CLOSE TO THE UH CLOSE TO THE HERE IN THE CENTRE SO UH THE YEAH
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0157090_0157466 BUT THA NO NO NO THE OTHER ONE THE THE ONE OP YEAH HERE THIS ONE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0157466_0158042 BUT THEN UH THAT THE THE QUESTION OF WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE SECOND POSITION THERE REMAINS FULLY OPEN
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0158156_0158644 SO I WOULD BE I WOULD BE MORE OF THE OPINION TO TO SEE WHETHER IT'S IT'S SO EVIDENT THAT
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0158644_0159454 LET'S SAY THE AT LEAST THE TWO FULL FULL TIME PROFESSORS THAT ARE HERE ON THE LIST WE HAVE ONE HERE BUT UH MAGGIE IS IS NOT PRESENT

AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0159756_0160633 IF IF IF BECAUSE OF PERSONAL PREFERENCES THEY WOULD BE HAPPY WITH A TWO PERSON ROOM WHICH MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0160633_0161053 I MEAN IT'S IT'S CERTAINLY NOT UH SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD IMPOSE BUT WE CAN ASK
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0161800_0161941 YEAH BUT THAT'S NOT REALISTIC EITHER
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0161941_0162520 I MEAN YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A FORE FOREIGN RESEARCHER COMING VISITING YOU AND YOU WILL PUT PUT HIM IN THE ADMIN OFFICE
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0162730_0162848 UH YOU'LL NOT DO THAT
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0162848_0163186 I MEAN UH MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT WITH AN EXCHANGE STUDENT THAT'S
AMI_IB4003_H03_MIO039_0163428_0163906 BUT YOU CAN'T TAKE A SENIOR VISITOR AND UH HIM IN THE IN THE SECRETARY

AMI_IB4004_H00_MIO036_0008459_0009467 BUT REGARDING THE CONSTRAINTS UM THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PLAN TO TO MAKE SEPARATIONS BETWEEN THE ROOMS SO THAT MEANS BASICALLY WELL
AMI_IB4004_H00_MIO036_0009467_0010113 WE HAVE TO DO WITH THIS SETTING AND UH IT'S IT'S QUITE DIFFICULT TO MAKE NEW DOORS AND NEW WALLS
AMI_IB4004_H00_MIO036_0010113_0010627 SO I THINK WE SHOULDN'T COUNT ON THEM IN THE NEXT UH FOUR YEARS MAYBE
AMI_IB4004_H00_MIO036_0010627_0011510 AND THEY DON'T WANT US TO SH I MEAN THEY DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE AN EXTRA WORKING SPACE FOR GISELLA WITH THE OTHER I. T. ADMINS
AMI_IB4004_H00_MIO036_0011510_0012018 WHICH WE COULD UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF FULL OVER THERE BUT UH AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID

AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0089193_0089742 NO THAT'S NOT COMPLETELY EQUIVALENT BECAUSE NANCY ALL ARE P. H. D. STUDENTS OR MASTERS STUDENTS BUT NANCY
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0089742_0089765 CORRECT
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0090292_0090326 OH

AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0092077_0092268 SO I WOULD SWITCH DAVID AND NANCY TYPICALLY
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0092476_0092704 WHICH DOESN'T MEAN THAT DAVID SHOULD BE IN THIS ROOM
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0092704_0092836 HE COULD BE IN THE OTHER ONE
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0092836_0093579 FOR ME UH THE TWO THREE PEOPLE ROOMS ARE REALLY THEY HAVE TO BE UH RE SHUFFLED ACCORDING TO PEOPLE PERSONAL PREFERENCES
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0093579_0094058 BUT I DEFINITELY WOULD PUT UH NANCY WITH AGNES IN THE TWO PERSON ROOM

AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0096868_0096992 I SEE IF YOU DO IT THIS WAY

AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0097556_0098151 BECAUSE DAVID WILL BE PART TIME AND THE OTHER ONE NOT SO OVERLOADED BECAUSE THERE IS UH ONE FREE POSITION UH
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0098151_0098553 KNOWING THAT THIS ONE FREE POSITION UH WILL NOT STAY FREE VERY LONG
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0098973_0099073 YES SO
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0099373_0100071 AND THIS IS STILL A WORRY FOR ME BECAUSE WE ARE STILL WE DON'T STILL STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR THE VISITORS
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0100272_0100424 UNLESS WE PUT THEM IN THE LOUNGE
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0100571_0100651 THEREFORE I W

AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0103246_0103427 SO THAT WE KEEP IT YOU MEAN
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0104627_0104871 IT DEPENDS IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE THINK ABOUT THE LOUNGE
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0104871_0105090 IF IT'S THOUGHT AS BEING A READING ROOM
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0105090_0105145 NO

AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0106666_0107572 AND I REALLY DO THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR LAB TO BE ABLE TO DECENTLY UH WELCOME VISITORS THAT COME TO THE LAB THAN TO HAVE A PLACE FOR READING NEWSPAPERS
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0107572_0107753 NEWSPAPERS YOU CAN READ THEM HOME

AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0108278_0109128 SO I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WHY WE SHOULD PUT PRIORITY ON LOUNGES IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SPACE FOR ACCOMMODATING VISITORS
AMI_IB4004_H03_MIO039_0109128_0109417 THAT'S JUST NOT NOT ACCORDING TO MY PRIORITIES

AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0016149_0016174 SURE
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0016349_0016530 IT'S NOT VERY LONG IN ANY CASE
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0016766_0016935 YEP
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0016935_0017110 YEAH
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0017260_0018073 OKAY SO WHAT I WAS THINKING IS BASICALLY THE PREVIOUS MOVIES THAT WE HAD WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED IN THE AGENDA D UM LAWRENCE OF ARABIA
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0018073_0018911 APOCALYPSE NOW AND AMADEUS WERE FAIRLY HISTORICAL SERIOUS DRAMATIC AND ALSO ACTION EY MOVIES EXCEPT FOR MAYBE AMADEUS
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0018911_0019619 UM THIS MONTH I WAS THINKING OF SELECTING SOMETHING THAT'S MORE IN THE PRESENT TIME STILL DRAMATIC BUT SLIGHTLY LESS SERIOUS
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0019727_0020133 AND WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS SOMETHING OF A THRILLER OR MYSTERY
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0020133_0020881 AND I KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND MYSTERY IS NOT REALLY MYSTERIOUS IN THE MOVIES THESE DAYS THEY KIND OF CAN PREDICT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0020881_0021399 UM BUT IN THE NINETIES THERE WERE SOME MOVIES THAT DID HAVE SURPRISE ENDINGS AND THAT PEOPLE CAME OUT SAYING OKAY
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0021399_0021798 DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING SO I THOUGHT WE COULD MAYBE SHOW ONE OF THOSE
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0021798_0022314 AND EVEN IF PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE A LOT OF THE TIMES YOU GO BACK AND WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0022314_0022648 AND YOU PICK UP ON THINGS THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE THE FIRST TIME AROUND
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0022648_0023240 OR YOU SEE WHERE THE CLUES WERE AND MM WHAT LED UP TO THE END SO THAT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT I WAS THINKING
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0023344_0023611 AND THE TWO IN PARTICULAR THAT I WOULD PROPOSE ARE
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0023740_0024119 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THE USUAL SUSPECTS AND THE SIXTH SENSE
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0024119_0024445 UM I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN ANY OF THEM
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0024445_0025114 UH THE USUAL SUSPECTS WAS DIRECTED BY BRYAN SINGER AND WRITTEN BY CHRISTOPHER MCQUARRIE
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0025114_0025852 IT HAS A FAIRLY LARGE CAST SO I'M NOT GONNA READ ALL OF THEM BUT THE MAIN CHARACTERS ARE KEVIN SPACEY AND GABRIEL BYRNE
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0025852_0026276 AND IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT FIVE CRIMINALS WHO GET SET UP
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0026276_0027094 UM THEY'RE ARRESTED THEY'RE RELEASED FROM PRISON AND THE GET TOGETHER UM AND PLAN A CRIME
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0027094_0027505 AND BASICALLY THE STORY IS TOLD THROUGH THE VIEWS OF ONE OF THE SUSPECTS
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0027583_0027902 UM THE TAG LINE IS KIND OF NEAT FIVE CRIMINALS ONE LINEUP
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0027902_0029108 NO COINCIDENCE AND YOU GET TOLD THE STORY UM AS UH THAT THESE F CHARACTERS ARE BEING CONTROLLED UM BY ONE SORT OF UBER VILLAIN
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0029108_0029414 AND IN THE END YOU FIND WHO THE UBER VILLAIN WAS
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0029414_0029975 AND I KIND OF LIKE THE THE QUOTE FROM ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0030387_0030560 WELL THEY HA HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THE MOVIE

AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0032020_0032401 IT'S ONE OF THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST AND SCARIEST CRIME THRILLERS TO COME ALONG SINCE PULP FICTION
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0032522_0033125 AND THE OTHER MOVIE IS THE SIXTH SENSE WITH THE FAMOUS LINE I SEE DEAD PEOPLE WHICH THE LITTLE BOY SAYS
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0033125_0033655 UM IT WAS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY M. NIGHT UH SHYAMALAN AND STARS BRUCE WILLIS
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0033655_0034249 HALEY JOEL OSMENT AND TONI COLLETTE AND AGAIN HAS A NEAT TWIST THAT YOU FIND OUT RIGHT AT THE END

AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0037727_0038337 SO THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE MINUTES LONG SO IT'S A DECENT LENGTH OF TIME
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0038337_0038848 IT HAS AN R. RATING SO I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT TYPE OF AUDIENCE WE HAD AT THE LAST
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0038920_0039294 UH SHOWS BUT IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE SUITABLE FOR KIDS

AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0055751_0055926 IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT ONE OUT OF TEN
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0055926_0056730 IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIRST IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND IT'S NINETEENTH ON YOUR LIST I THINK IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN

AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0057973_0058465 BUT IT GOT A LOT OF BUZZ AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKED IT SO
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0058626_0059274 THOSE ARE MY TWO SELECTIONS AND AS YOU CAN SEE THE PLOT IS A BOY WHO COMMUNICATES WITH SPIRITS THAT DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE DEAD
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0059274_0059762 SEEKS THE HELP OF A DISHEARTENED CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST TO FIGURE OUT WHY HE'S SEEING WHAT HE'S SEEING AND
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0059898_0059977 WHAT IT MEANS
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0060716_0060823 YEAH

AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0062298_0062835 SO THOSE WOULD BE MY TWO SUGGESTIONS AND Y THEY AR THEY ARE SLIGHTLY MORE COMMERCIAL
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0062835_0063171 OR AT LEAS THE SIXTH SENSE IS THAN THE OTHER ONES WE'VE SEEN BUT
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0063488_0063530 YEAH
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0064012_0064451 YEAH THEY WERE THEY WERE NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT AWARDS THEY DIDN'T WIN

AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0084093_0084316 THAT'S ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT IT'S
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0085461_0085984 YEAH BUT AMADEUS ISN'T REALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EIGHTIES EITHER
AMI_IB4010_H00_FIE038_0085984_0086551 YEAH AND ACCORDING TO YOUR THING IT'S NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR SO

AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0161872_0162970 UM SO MY PROPOSAL WHICH IS ONLY A PROPOSAL WOULD BE TO TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON UM UH MORE OR LESS HISTORY AND ACTION
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0162970_0163552 SO LAWRENCE OF ARABIA WAS OKAY ABOUT THIS GUY DURING THE FIRST WORLD WAR SO IT HAPPENS
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0163552_0164026 OKAY OUTSIDE EUROPE AND THE STATES BUT UH IT'S A PIECE OF HISTORY
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0164026_0164596 UH APOCALYPSE NOW IT'S UH VIETNAM IF I'M UM CORRECT AND OKAY AMADEUS
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0164596_0165215 THAT'S MUCH UH MUCH EARLIER AND IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT VIOLENT WHICH IS A NICE THING I THINK
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0165215_0166115 BUT UM GIVEN THAT WE WOULD LIKE A MOVIE FROM THE NINETIES I THOUGHT THE SAVING PRIVATE RYAN OH THANKS FOR PROJECTING THE DOCUMENT
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0166152_0167065 UM WOULD KEEP THIS MORE OR LESS THIS THEME OF UH HISTORY AND WAR AND ACTION DRAMA
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0167065_0167647 WHILE SHOWING ACTUALLY A VERY NEW AND I WOULD SAY HUMANISTIC VIEW ON ON WAR
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0167647_0168489 BECAUSE IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THE SORT OF GLORIFICATION OF UH YOU KNOW THE GOOD GUYS THAT THAT UH WELL GO AGAINST THE NAZIS
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0168489_0168967 BUT UH IT'S UH IT'S WELL THE PLOT ACTUALLY IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0168970_0169671 IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE LOOKING FOR JUST ONE SOLDIER IN FACT IT'S UM IT'S ABOUT A A FAMILY OF FOUR BROTHERS
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0169671_0170279 WHO ACTUALLY THREE OF THEM GET KILLED DURING THE WAR IN THESE DAYS OF FORTY WELL
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0170279_0171307 I GUESS SUMMER FORTY FOUR AND THE UH WELL THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES THAT THEY NEED TO GET BACK THE FOURTH BROTHER JUST TO SAVE ONE MEMBER OF THE FAMILY
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0171307_0171512 AND THIS THIS GUY IS PRIVATE RYAN
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0171579_0172333 SO THE MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT KILLING THE GERMANS OR WHATEVER IT'S ABOUT SAVING AT LEAST ONE GUY FROM A FAMILY
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0172333_0173021 SO BUT OF COURSE THE THE SETTING IS DURING THE WAR AND UM IT'S VERY REALISTIC AND UH VERY DRAMATIC IN FACT
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0173021_0173818 IT'S UM IT'S NOT AT ALL A GLORIFICATION OF WAR BUT IT'S JUST UH IT SHOWS A BIT UH THE VIOLENCE OF UM OF THE THINGS
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0173818_0174567 AND ESPECIALLY THE THE BEGINNING IS UH I THINK IT'S GREAT IT'S IT'S VERY VIOLENT BUT IT'S IT'S AN IMAGE OF OF WAR
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0174567_0174661 IT'S UH
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0174904_0175352 YEAH BUT I THINK IF MM WELL IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0175609_0176174 IT YEAH IT'S THE LANDING AND ACTUALLY EVERY MORE OR LESS EVERYONE GETS KILLED AND
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0176520_0176996 OH I I DIDN'T KNOW BUT YEAH ACTUALLY IT'S VERY WELL FILMED AND IT'S VERY REALISTIC
AMI_IB4010_H01_MIO036_0176996_0177498 AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COMPARE WITH I DON'T KNOW IN LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I THINK THEY HAVE SOME BATTLES AND CAMELS

AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0003449_0003560 ARE YOU GONNA TAKE THE MINUTES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0003670_0003690 GOOD

AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0008498_0008549 SURE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0009054_0009841 OKAY SO THE PREVIOUS MOVIES THAT WE'VE DONE THIS YEAR WERE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA APOP APOCALYPSE NOW AND AMADEUS
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0009841_0010332 WHICH WERE ALL HISTORICAL SERIOUS DRAMATIC AND SOMEWHAT ACTIONY MOVIES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0010332_0011304 SO FOR THIS MONTH I PROPOSE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT PREFERABLY SOMETHING SET IN THE PRESENT UM SOMETHING MAYBE DRAMATIC BUT SLIGHTLY LESS SERIOUS
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0011304_0011611 SO WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS ACTUALLY A THRILLER OR A MYSTERY
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0011611_0012276 AND WHILE THESE DAYS PEOPLE ARE SO JADED BY GENERAL MOVIES THAT THEY TEND NOT TO BE SURPRISED BY THE ENDINGS IN MYSTERIES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0012276_0013094 SOME MOVIES IN THE NINETIES DID ACTUALLY HAVE TWISTS THAT PEOPLE CAME OUT SAYING NEVER SAW THAT COMING I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0013172_0013613 AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS PRESENT YOU TWO OF THOSE MOVIES AND BEFORE ANYONE SAYS THAT WELL
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0013613_0014066 IF YOU KNOW TH HOW THE MOVIE ENDS YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANNA SEE IT AGAIN THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0014066_0014556 BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO RE WATCH MOVIES UM TO SEE WHERE THE CLUES WERE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0014556_0014972 WHAT THEY MISSED THINGS THEY DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THE FIRST TIME AROUND
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0014972_0015297 UM SO IF YOU CAN GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0015297_0015740 WHAT I'D PROPOSE IS EITHER THE USUAL SUSPECTS OR THE SIXTH SENSE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0015740_0016222 UM THE USUAL SUSPECTS IS SLIGHTLY LESS MAINSTREAM
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0016222_0016771 UM IS HAS A FAIRLY LARGE CAST NOTABLY KEVIN SPACEY GABRIEL BYRNE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0016771_0017348 UM AND IT WAS DIRECTED BY BRYAN SINGER IT'S ONE OF HIS EARLIER MOVIES I THINK
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0017348_0017572 IT WAS WRITTEN BY QUIST CHRISTOPHER MCQUARRIE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0017657_0018441 UM AND ACCORDING TO ROLLING STONE IT'S THE FRESHEST FUNNIEST AND SCARIEST CRIME THRIL THRILLER TO COME ALONG SINCE PULP FICTION
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0018441_0019161 UH THE SIXTH SENSE ON THE OTHER HAND IS A MORE COMMERCIAL MOVIE WITH ITS FAMOUS LINE I SEE DEAD PEOPLE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0019161_0019912 UM IT WAS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY M. NIGHT UH SHYAMALAN AND STARS BRUCE WILLIS HALEY JOEL OSMENT AND TONI COLLETTE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0019912_0020700 AND IT'S ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO SEES DEAD PEOPLE AND I HE SEES A CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST TO TRY TO GET HIM TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE SEES THE DEAD PEOPLE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0020700_0020775 WHAT IT MEANS
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0021077_0021593 NOW THAT YOU'VE GIVEN AWAY THE TWIST YES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0021593_0021649 UM
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0021835_0021879 YEAH
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0023314_0023817 SEND YOUR COMPLAINTS TO ROLLING STONE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0023817_0024513 SO ON THE NEXT COUPLE OF SLIDES I'LL JUST GO THROUGH SOME OF UM MORE DETAILED STUFF THAT WE MIGHT NEED FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0024513_0025047 UM THE LENGTH FOR THE USUAL SUSPECTS UM IS A HUNDRED AND FIVE MINUTES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0025047_0025486 UH AS YOU CAN S WELL AS ANDREI ALREADY SAID IT'S N NINETEEN NINETY FIVE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0025486_0026189 IT HAS AN R. RATING WHICH MEANS THAT AT LEAST IN THE IN NORTH AMERICA IT WAS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE UNDER EIGHTEEN
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0026189_0026613 'CAUSE IT'S FAIRLY VIOLENT BUT NOT SO VIOLENT AS OTHER MOVIES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0026613_0027367 UM PLOT OUTLINE UH FIVE VILLAINS IN NEW YORK ARE ROUNDED UP BY THE POLICE IN AN UNCONVENTIONAL MANNER THAT WORRIES THEM
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0027367_0027812 AFTER RELEASE THEY GET TOGETHER FOR A SPOT OF REVENGE BUT SOMEONE ELSE IS CONTROLLING EVENTS
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0027812_0028072 AND THE BIG MYSTERY OF THE MOVIE IS WHO'S CONTROLLING THE EVENTS
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0028141_0028604 UM IT GOT AN EIGHT POINT SEVEN OUT OF TEN USER RATING ON THE INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0028604_0028967 IT'S SIXTEENTH IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MOVIES OF ALL TIME
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0028967_0029608 FORTH IN DENIS'S LIST OF THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETEEN NINETIES WHICH I THINK WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM I. M. D. B.
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0029608_0030230 UM IT WON SEVERAL ACADEMY AWARDS INCLUDING BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR AND BEST WRITING
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0030230_0030937 UM BEST FILM FOR THE BRITISH EQUIVALENT OF THE ACADEMY AWARDS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A CESAR FOR BEST FOREIGN FILM
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0030937_0031233 SO IT GOT A FAIR BIT OF RECOGNITION DESPITE NOT BEING
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0031348_0031936 UM A VERY MAINSTREAM HIGH BUDGET MOVIE OR MAYBE BECAUSE IT WASN'T A MAINSTREAM HIGH BUDGET MOVIE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0032418_0032739 I DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT IN FACT OTHER THAN
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0032898_0033189 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU'VE SEEN IT
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0033298_0033876 AND DON'T THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SEEN IT IT'S NOT A VERY VERY WELL KNOWN MOVIE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0033876_0033910 WHAT
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0034093_0034122 IS IT
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0034362_0034387 SEE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0034744_0034783 REALLY
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0034888_0035193 THAT SURPRISES ME I ALWAYS GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0035654_0035782 YEAH
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0035782_0035884 WELL IT'S A GOOD MOVIE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0036197_0036233 YEAH
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0037409_0037430 YEAH
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0037660_0037999 SO BUT I THINK THE MAIN THING IS IT'S GOT A GOOD TWIST AT THE END AND
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0038125_0038377 IT'S IT'S AN INTERESTING MOVIE TO WATCH
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0038551_0038772 UM SO IF YOU GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0038772_0038988 MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING FOR THE SIXTH SENSE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0038988_0039387 IT'S SLIGHTLY NEWER NINETEEN NINETY NINE MORE OR LESS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0039387_0040054 IT HAS A LOWER RATING 'CAUSE IT'S LESS VIOLENT BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT AUDIENCE WE ARE GONNA HAVE AT THE SHOWINGS
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0040193_0040924 IT HAS IT'S SCARY AND I THINK IT HAS SOME SORT OF SLIGHT VIOLENCE BUT
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0041258_0041593 YEAH BUT THEY'RE NOT VIOLENTLY DEAD
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0041719_0042414 IT'S IT'S MORBID AND IT'S CREEPY BUT IT'S NOT VIOLENT AS IN PEOPLE BEING SLICED IN HALF OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0042414_0043089 UM UM IT'S NINETEENTH IN THE TOP MOVIES OF THE NINETIES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0043089_0043693 HUNDRED FIRST IN THE TOP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY IT WAS NOMINATED FOR A LOT OF AWARDS IT DIDN'T WIN
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0043808_0043905 AS MANY
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0043905_0044634 MIGHT HAVE WON MORE SORT OF MINOR AWARDS BUT AT LEAST THE ACADEMY AWARDS IT WAS NOMINATED FOR FIVE OF THEM UM BUT DIDN'T WIN
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0044634_0045112 NEVERTHELESS STILL A GOOD MOVIE STILL A GOOD TWIST AT THE END WHICH DENIS ALREADY GAVE AWAY
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0045268_0045413 GOOD
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0045413_0045648 UM SO THOSE WOULD BE MY TWO CHOICES
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0046404_0046811 LET IT'S A SORT OF DIFFERENT STYLE FROM THE OTHER MOVIES WE'VE SEEN AND THEY HAVE A TWIST
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0046811_0047242 SO IT'S NOT YOUR GENERAL MOVIE WHERE YOU JUST KIND OF SIT THROUGH IT AND GO OH OKAY GET UP AND LEAVE
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0047242_0047680 IT'S AT LEAST OUT OF THOSE TWO MOVIES I CAME OUT THINKING OH COOL OKAY
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0047879_0047984 YEAH BUT
AMI_IB4011_H00_FIE038_0048112_0048309 I MEAN THAT'S A GOOD THING RIGHT

AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0123140_0123658 WE DECIDED TO TO PRESENT THIS MONTH A MOVIE FROM THE THE NINETIES
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0123658_0124496 UM I THOUGHT THAT AMONG THESE MOVIES WHO LOOK QUITE POPULAR UH SAVING PRIVATE RYAN WOULD BE A VERY GOOD CANDIDATE
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0124496_0124631 UM
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0124715_0124822 ACTUALLY IT'S A MOVIE I'VE SEEN
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0124822_0125030 HAVE YOU SEEN IT BEFORE
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0125030_0125449 OKAY SO YOU'VE ALL SEEN IT SO MAYBE EVERYONE HAS SEEN IT I'M NOT VERY SURE
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0125449_0125883 UM BUT I THINK IT'S A VERY NOVEL TREATMENT OF OF WAR
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0125883_0126635 IT'S UH IT'S NO LONGER THE B GLORIFICATION OF UH WHATEVER COMBAT AND VICTORY BUT THE PLOT IS QUITE DIFFERENT
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0126635_0127673 IT'S ABOUT SAVING ONE PERSON WHO HAS A SPECIAL SPECIAL VALUE IN THE IN THE MOVIE UM IF ONLY BECAUSE HIS BROTHERS ACTUALLY WERE ALL KILLED
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0127673_0128158 SO UH THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT THEY SHOULD SAVE AT LEAST ONE PERSON FROM THE FAMILY
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0128158_0128713 AND SAVING MEANS ACTUALLY REMOVING FROM THE THE FRONT IF YOU IF RE IF YOU REMEMBER THE PLOT
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0128722_0129259 SO IN FACT THIS GUY THE PRIVATE RYAN IS NOT AT ALL THE MAIN ACTOR THE THE MAIN A WELL
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0129259_0130253 THE MAIN CHARACTER IS UH PLAYED BY TOM HANKS AND IT'S ACTUALLY YOU CAN SEE HIS PICTURE ON THE SECOND PAGE OF MY MY NOTES UH CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0130253_0131003 SO HE IS SENT WITH THIS RATHER STRANGE MISSION WHICH IS NOT A COMBAT MISSION BUT THEY UH THEY WANT JUST TO TO GET THIS GUY BACK
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0131003_0131530 WHICH IS IN FACT THIS GUY IS I THINK BEHIND ENEMY LINES OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0131530_0131940 SO IT HAPPENS IN IN EUROPE JUST AFTER THE THE NORMANDY LANDING
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0131940_0132637 AND IT'S VERY VERY STRIKING THE WAY THEY THEY FILMED ALL THE THE COMBAT SCENES AND UH IT'S IT'S VERY DRAMATIC
AMI_IB4011_H01_MIO036_0132637_0133287 IT'S UH IT'S NOT YOU KNOW LIKE IN THE MOVIES FROM THE FIFTIES OR THE SIXTIES WHERE PEOPLE JUST FALL AND DIE ANONYMOUSLY

AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0019695_0019827 I'M NUMBER TWO
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0020040_0020075 THAT'S IT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0020623_0020703 I'LL DO THE NOTES
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0020703_0020811 YEAH THANKS
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0021157_0022211 SO UM WELL I I FIGURED UH WE SHOULD UM IDENTIFY SOME USER REQUIREMENTS AND FROM MY EXPERIENCE I WANNA UH
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0022211_0023029 AND FROM RESEARCH I DID UH THE THE DEVICE HAS TO TURN THE TELEVISION ON AND OFF THE FIRST TIME YOU PRESS ON THE BIG BUTTON
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0023029_0023522 YOU CAN'T UH CAN'T HAVE LIKE UH WAFFLING ON THIS POINT YOU KNOW
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0023522_0023572 REALLY HAVE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0023587_0023815 IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE Y Y HAVE TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0023864_0024354 BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH REMOTE CONTROLS IS FINDING THEM
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0024449_0025001 SO UH I ALSO SINCE WE HAVE TO ESTABLISH OUR CORPORATE IMAGE ON THE BASIS OF THIS NEW PRODUCT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0025001_0025575 THOUGHT WE BETTER LOOK AT THINGS THAT ARE POPULAR AND UM EX GO BEYOND THOSE AND AS I SAID IN THE FIRST MEETING
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0025658_0026431 UM AND THEN UH WE MIGHT WANNA TALK EVENTUALLY ABOUT THE MATERIALS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO USE IN UH IN THE CONSTRUCTION
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0026431_0027264 ESPECIALLY IN THE THE UH THE OUTSIDE OF THE PRODUCT SO THAT IT GIVES THE APPEARANCE AND IT IS RELIABLE AND SO FORTH
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0027367_0027972 I DID A LITTLE HISTORY ON UH THE THE UH REMOTE CONTROLS AND WHEN THEY WERE INVENTED AND SO FORTH
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0027972_0028429 SO I GUESS THIS GUY ZENITH UH CREATED THE FLASHMATIC
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0028429_0028533 WHICH I KINDA LIKE THE IDEA
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0028533_0029329 'CAUSE IT MADE ME THINK OF UM UM MAYBE THE REMOTE CONTROL MADE A BIG FLASH WHEN UH YOU TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0029393_0030349 AND UM SO IT WAS HIGHLY DIRECTIONAL FLASH LIGHT THAT UH YOU COULD TURN THE PICTURE ON AND OFF
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0030349_0031294 AND THE SOUND ON AND OFF AND CHANGE CHANNELS C SO I THINK UM THOSE ARE STILL REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE TODAY UH FIFTY YEARS LATER
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0031360_0031882 AND UH IT WAS REALLY A PIONEERING INNOVATION BUT IT WAS UH SENSITIVE TO THE SUN
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0031882_0032624 SO THAT UH IT WOULD GET WOULD START OFF BY THE YOU'D GET IT WOULD EASILY CAUSE UM PROBLEMS
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0032708_0032806 SO UH
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0032886_0034256 I IN ADDITION TO UH LOOKING AT THE UM UH THE FUNCTIONAL REQUIR SO ALL THESE DEVICES ARE EXAMPLES OF WHERE UH MM THEY REPRESENT EXAMPLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TODAY
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0034256_0034413 WHICH I THINK THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0034464_0034824 IS R UM REALLY UH SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0034824_0034938 IT'D BE EASY TO FIND
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0035022_0036068 AND UM IT WOULD UH Y YOU'D YOU COULD THROW IT AT THINGS IF IF THE T. V. DIDN'T TURN ON AND OFF YOU COULD USE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0036099_0036650 AND SINCE I'M NOT REALLY UM INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS SLIDE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0036714_0036836 BUT UM
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0036848_0037607 I JUST TOOK SOME DIFFERENT UH SCHEMATICS AND I PUT THEM INTO THIS
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0037607_0038007 AND I GUESS THIS IS WHAT A SLIDE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IF YOU WERE DRAWING A CIRCUIT BOARD
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0038007_0038266 I DON'T KNOW WHY UM WE WERE ASKED TO DO THIS
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0038312_0038369 SO
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0038436_0038781 UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0038824_0039133 I THINK WE COULD UH I I'M REALLY THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX HERE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0039133_0040008 AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER PERHAPS HAVING AN AN AN A A SIZE UH A REMOTE CONTROL THAT CHANGES IN SIZE DEPENDING ON THE USER PREFERENCE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0040034_0040396 SO SOMETHING THAT'S VERY VERY FLEXIBLE AND INFLATABLE AND THEN YOU COULD SHRINK IT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0040442_0040906 I THINK UM IT COULD EITHER BE YOU COULD GO EITHER ONE EXTREME BE VERY COLOURFUL
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0040906_0041371 OR YOU COULD MAKE IT CLEAR AND UM KIND OF BLEND IN WITH THINGS
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0041371_0042095 SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO UM UH HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE TH THE DECORATION OF THE OF THE USER'S HOME
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0042152_0042440 UM I THINK UH IT NEEDS TO BE WATERPROOF
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0042440_0043054 BECAUSE UH SOMETIMES THEY FALL INTO CUPS AND YOU KNOW IT MIGHT BE OUT BY THE SWIMMING POOL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0043097_0043875 UM IF YOU UH MI ONE OF ONE OF MY REQUIREMENTS WAS ABOUT NEEDS T TO TELL YOU WHEN IT'S DONE ITS JOB OR NOT BECAUSE HALF THE TIME
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0043875_0044385 I KEEP PUSHING ON THE REMOTE CONTROL AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ACTUALLY UNDERSTOOD MY MESSAGE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0044385_0044647 SO I THINK IT SHOULD GIVE YOU SOME SORT OF AN ORAL CUE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0044692_0044988 AND UH COURSE I NEVER WANNA REPLACE THE BATTERY
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0044994_0045420 SO THAT'S THOSE ARE MY F PREFERENCES AND THAT'S MY PRESENTATION
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0046146_0046213 YES
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0047009_0047142 RUN OVER IT WITH A CAR

AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0052570_0053076 TITANIUM WOULD BE BE HEAVY TOO WOULDN'T IT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0053314_0053824 NO I HAVEN'T REALLY UM I WANTED FEEDBACK I THINK WE NEED TO RATE RANK THESE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0053824_0054170 BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT YOUR UH PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE AND YOUR THOUGHTS
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0054390_0054503 I LIKE TITANIUM
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0054503_0054570 IT'S LIGHT

AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0055720_0056069 IT'D BE HARD TO INFLATE SOMETHING OU MADE OUT OF TITANIUM THOUGH
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0070534_0070733 NOT FAT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0070884_0071033 NOT FAT HUH
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0071196_0071321 MIGHT BE HARD TO FIND THOUGH
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0071672_0071720 OH OKAY
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0081645_0081846 SPEECH RECOGNITION

AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0093135_0094435 SO UM MIGHT UH WE CAN PERHAPS UM DO IT IF THE USER IS WILLING TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE TRAINING PROCESS
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0094435_0095017 UH IT COULD REDUCE TH TH UH THE OVERALL UM COST
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0095069_0095120 NOT SURE HOW
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0095140_0096065 BUT UM ANYWAY UM I I THINK ALSO THAT UH THIS MIGHT IMPACT THE BATTERY LIFE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0096149_0097240 AND UM SO MAYBE WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO DO IS UM ADD SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN UM RECHARGE IT WIRELESSLY
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0097360_0097666 SO THAT UH Y YOU KNOW SEN SEND POWER TO IT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0097780_0098280 SO UH OR MAYBE UH SET IT OUT IN THE SUN AND IT UH YOU KNOW GETS UH FROM THE LIGHT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0098280_0099157 UM A A SOLAR CELL INSIDE THERE SO THAT UH YOU HAVE ENOUGH UH JUICE TO DO ALL THESE FANCY THINGS

AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0151072_0152036 THE ONLY THING THAT I SAW MISSING FROM UH YOUR YOUR RESEARCH THAT WE FOUND WAS THIS UH ABILITY TO FIND THE DOGGONE THING WHEN YOU NEED IT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0152146_0152309 SO UH YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S OKAY
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0152309_0153109 THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL HERE AT THE TABLE SO THAT IF WE THINK OF IT AND OUR RESEARCH INDICATES CERTAIN THINGS AND UM W WE IT'S COMPLEMENTARY
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0153199_0154145 I ALSO THINK THAT UM UH TH F THE THE FEEL OF IT IS UH WHEN YOU HOLD IT
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0154145_0155059 IS SOMETHING THAT UM UH WAS EXPRESSED MORE IN IN IN IN MY UH DESIGN
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0155104_0156049 AND THAT'S LOGICAL AND NORMAL 'CAUSE THOSE ARE THE PARAMETERS THAT AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGNER'S MORE THINKING ABOUT TH TH THE LOOK AND THE FEEL AND UH YOU'RE
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0156232_0156287 FIRST

AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0165477_0166350 I THINK WE SHOULD DO AS MANY FEATURES AS UH START WITH ALL OF THEM RIGHT NOW AND ELIMINATE THEM LATER IN THE PROCESS THAT'S MY SUGGESTION
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0167006_0167292 YOU CAN OBJECT IF YOU WANT TO
AMI_IS1008b_H01_FIE073_0170301_0170698 I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE THAT AS AN ACTION ITEM FOR AFTER THE MEETING 'CAUSE W OUR MEETING TIME HAS RUN OUT

AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0051679_0052364 'CAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE UNBREAKABLE THING DOING SOMETHING PLASTIC WOULD BE HARDER WHEREAS HAVING SOMETHING LIKE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0052364_0053008 I DUNNO STEEL OR TITANIUM ISN'T REALLY ECONOMICALLY VIABLE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0053041_0053114 YEAH

AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0065129_0065284 AND THAT'S MINE I THINK
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0065831_0065886 IN MODIFIED

AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0099127_0099479 IT SEEMS ALSO LIKE WITH THE SPEECH RECOGNITION YEAH IT'S A GREAT FEATURE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0099479_0099899 BUT IF YOU'RE WATCHING T. V. THERE'S A LOT OF AMBIENT SOUND AND IT'S WORDS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0099899_0100166 IT'S NOT JUST YOU KNOW NOISES LIKE SOMETHING HITTING
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0100224_0101153 IT'S ACTUAL SPEECH SO THEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPEECH RECOGNIZER IS GOOD ENOUGH TO FILTER OUT THE T. V. SPEECH AND THE THE USER'S SPEECH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0101153_0101313 OTHERWISE YOU CAN SAY REMOTE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0101313_0101979 BUT IF SOMEONE ON THE SCREEN IS SAYING THE SAME THING ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE IN A MOVIE SAYING OFF AND YOUR SCREEN DIES
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0102031_0102448 BECAUSE THEY'VE TRIGGERED THE REMOTE CONTROL AND IT'S TURNED OFF YOUR T. V.
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0102538_0103255 SO I THINK IF WE CAN FIND A SPEECH RECOGNIZER THAT CAN HANDLE THOSE TYPES OF PROBLEMS THEN YEAH IT'D BE A REALLY GOOD MARKETING GIMMICK
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0103255_0103673 BUT I THINK WE SERIOUSLY NEED TO CONSIDER HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0103863_0103961 THE SITUATION

AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0132379_0132504 THANKS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0132504_0132582 YEAH AND THAT'S FINE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0132839_0132916 OKAY
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0132916_0133231 SO BASICALLY
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0133231_0133918 THE METHOD THAT WE USUALLY USE IN THE USER INTERFACE DESIGN IS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE LIKE AND WHAT PEOPLE DON'T LIKE ABOUT EXISTING PRODUCTS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0133918_0134113 SO IN OUR CASE EXISTING REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0134164_0134730 AND THEN WHAT THE GOOD IDEAS ARE AND WHAT THE BAD IDEAS ARE AND WHY THEY'RE BAD AND GOOD WHICH ISN'T ALWAYS AS OBVIOUS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0134730_0135095 WE SEEM TO HAVE INTUITIONS ABOUT WHY THINGS ARE GOOD OR THINGS ARE BAD
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0135095_0135631 BUT WHEN YOU LOOK TECHNICALLY AT HOW IT WORKS SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT THE CASE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0135689_0136380 THEN WE NEED TO DECIDE WHAT FUNCTIONALITIES WE REALLY WANT TO KEEP 'CAUSE THAT'LL FEED INTO BOTH ED'S WORK AND CHRISTINE'S WORK
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0136452_0137065 UM AND THEN WHAT THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD LOOK LIKE OBVIOUSLY ONCE WE'VE GOT A GOOD IDEA OF WHAT THE FUNCTIONALITIES ARE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0137141_0137560 SO IN TERMS OF THE FUNCTIONALITIES THAT WE NEED YOU OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0137560_0138112 YOU NEED TO CHANGE CHANNELS BOTH BY DIRECTLY GOING TO A SPECIFIC CHANNEL OR BY CHANNEL SURFING
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0138112_0138768 YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE VOLUME AND THEN CONTROL ANY MENUS ON THE T. V. TO REGULATE CONTRAST OR WHATEVER
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0139205_0139718 SO THE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE EXPRESSED IS THAT THERE'S TOO MANY BUTTONS ON REMOTE CONTROLS IN GENERAL
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0139762_0140079 THE BUTTONS IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0140133_0140818 UM OFTEN YOU NEED TO KNOW SPECIFIC BUTTON SEQUENCES TO GET CERTAIN FUNCTIONALITIES DONE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0140818_0141293 UM WHICH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS REMEMBER ESPECIALLY IF IT'S A FUNCTIONALITY THAT YOU DON'T USE VERY OFTEN
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0141340_0141489 AND THAT THE BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0141614_0142443 SO HERE WE'VE GOT TWO EXAMPLES WHERE HERE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU CAN SEE A REMOTE CONTROL THAT HAS LOTS AND LOTS OF BUTTONS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0142443_0142670 THE BUTTONS IN A LOT OF CASES ARE TINY
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0142758_0143404 UM THEY'RE HARD TO SEE AND OKAY THEY'RE LABELLED BUT THE LABELS DON'T NECESSARILY TELL YOU TOO MUCH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0143433_0144272 WHEREAS ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE A MUCH SIMPLER REMOTE CONTROL THAT I THINK BASICALLY HAS THE MINIMUM FUNCTIONALITIES THAT ARE NEEDED
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0144272_0144829 AND IT SORT OF LOOKS SIMPLER AND JUST LESS IMPOSING WHEN YOU FIRST LOOK AT IT
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0144829_0145406 SO I WOULD BE INCLINED TO GO SORT OF TOWARDS THIS IN TERMS OF DESIGN RATHER THAN THIS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0145454_0146129 AND IF THERE'S SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITIES THAT REQUIRE MORE BUTTONS THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT WITH EXISTING UM BUTTONS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0146202_0146624 SO MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES ARE TO KEEP THE NUMBER OF BUTTONS TO A LIMIT OR TO A MINIMUM
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0146624_0146998 SORRY MAKE FREQUENTLY USED BUTTONS BIGGER AND MORE STRATEGICALLY PLACED
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0146998_0147789 SO LIKE THE ON BUTTON BEING REALLY OBVIOUS ONE THE CHANNEL CHANGING AND THE VOLUME AND TO KEEP THE DESIGN BASICALLY SLEEK AND SIMPLE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0147943_0148540 WHICH I THINK TIES INTO WHAT CHRISTINE AND ED HAVE BOTH SAID FAIRLY REASONABLY
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0148570_0148822 UM SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT AN
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0148989_0149339 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0150665_0150702 YEP
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0152053_0152203 YES THAT'S TRUE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0152203_0152222 YEAH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0152935_0152955 YEAH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0155046_0155118 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0155118_0155149 YEAH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0155758_0155777 YEAH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0155993_0156157 OH THAT'S DEFINITELY A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0156157_0156813 ESPECIALLY TO USERS WHO ARE GONNA BE BUYING THE THING AND THEN USING IT ALMOST ON AN DAILY BASIS IN A LOT OF CASES I THINK
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0158119_0158145 OH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0160015_0160641 SHOULD WE MAYBE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT FEATURES WE ACTUALLY WANT TO INCLUDE 'CAUSE WE'VE THROWN A LOT OF FEATURES ONTO THE TABLE BUT
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0160772_0161344 DO WE ACTUALLY WANT TO INCORPORATE ALL OF THEM OR HAVE WE MISSED ANYTHING
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0161862_0161891 SURE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0164534_0164565 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0165478_0165533 I THOUGHT
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0167200_0167464 NO I I'M JUST THINKING IN TERMS OF TIME LIKE IF
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0167524_0167730 YES NOW I'M OBJECTING
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0167730_0168397 NO I MEAN I WAS JUST THINKING IS IT REALLY PRACTICAL TO START DESIGNING SOMETHING WITH FEATURES THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA END UP THROWING AWAY
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0168397_0169254 I MEAN IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT FOR EVERYONE TO CONSIDER DIFFERENT FEATURES UM
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0169342_0169725 AND S IF WE SPEND THAT TIME AND EFFORT ON FEATURES THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA USE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0169725_0170276 MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO SPEND IT ON THE F THINKING MORE ABOUT FEATURES THAT WE ACTUALLY DO WANT BUT
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0170305_0170387 I GUESS
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0170722_0170768 SURE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0170880_0170905 YEAH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0171048_0171074 YEAH
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0171074_0171120 SURE
AMI_IS1008b_H02_FIE038_0173153_0173190 OKAY
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0034493_0034718 FANTASTIC
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0052592_0052762 TITANIUM
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0054673_0054740 EXPENSIVE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0065954_0066265 I DON'T KNOW I THINK VERBALLY WE CAN WE CAN PRETTY MUCH SELL
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0071515_0071526 HMM
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0072472_0072984 UH FROM HER SIDE I DON'T THINK UH THERE'S TOO MANY MORE QUESTIONS
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0072984_0073105 IF YOU CAN COME TO THE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0073543_0074175 OKAY FROM THE MARKETING YEAH FROM THE MARKETING SIDE JUST TO TO GIVE AN IDEA WHAT THE MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING FOR
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0074175_0074512 I WAS LOOKING FOR A A REMOTE CONTROL TO HAVE A S
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0074759_0075442 I HAVE A SALES PRICE OF TWENTY FIVE EURO WITH A PRODUCTION PRICE OF UH TWELVE AND A HALF EURO
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0075677_0076413 FOR WHAT UH I THINK FROM WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND WE'RE TR WE'RE LOOKING FOR I DON'T THINK THAT PRICE IS EXACTLY IN THE MARKET
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0076495_0076553 OKAY
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0076580_0076895 I'LL EXPLAIN MYSELF HERE NOW IN THE SENSE THAT UH
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0077024_0077567 IN A IN THE RECENT SURVEYS UH FROM THE AGES FR FROM FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0077567_0077957 EIGHTY PERCENT ARE WILLING TO SPEND MORE MONEY FOR SOMETHING AS FANCY AS TRENDY
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0078059_0078359 TWENTY FIVE EUROS UH THAT'S THAT'S A PRESON REASONABLE PRICE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0078359_0078499 THAT'S A MARKET PRICE RIGHT NOW
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0078569_0079135 NOW IF WE'RE GONNA TAKE A RISK AND PUSH THIS UP A BIT MAKE IT MORE EXPENSIVE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0079135_0079650 BUT GIVE THEM ADDED THINGS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE NOW THEN IT W IT COULD POSSIBLY SELL
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0079650_0079764 OBVIOUSLY THE RISK IS THERE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0079797_0079961 TOO EXPENSIVE THEY'RE NOT GONNA BUY
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0080008_0081010 BUT I THINK UH THERE'S ONE OTHER THING INTERESTING TWO THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING IS THAT UH FROM THE FIFTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD GROUP
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0081010_0081520 WHICH ALWAYS SPENDS MORE MONEY ON TRENDY NEW THINGS SPEECH RECOGNITION IS REQUESTED
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0081649_0082453 AND WE'RE TALKING BETWEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO NINETY PERCENT OF THIS GROUP IS WILLING TO PAY FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION ON A REMOTE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0082547_0082976 OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T MAKE A REMOTE INTO A COMPUTER BUT MAYBE SIMPLE COMMANDS
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0083087_0083479 I DUNNO LOUDER SOFTER ON OFF
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0083627_0084142 THAT MIGHT BE A POSSIBILITY EVEN THOUGH IT COSTS MORE TO BE THE FIRST ON THE MARKET TO PRODUCE THIS
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0084275_0084500 THIRTY FIVE PERCENT SAY THEY'RE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0084537_0084804 SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY OF MAKING IT UM MORE USER FRIENDLY
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0084873_0085462 UH FIFTY PERCENT SAY THEY CAN'T FIND THE REMOTE HALF THE TIME
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0085545_0086004 SO MAYBE ONE WORD SPEECH RECOGNITION COMMANDS SAY REMOTE AND THERE'S A BEEP BEEP BEEP
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0086004_0086551 AND THEY CAN FIND IT THROUGH YOU KNOW TEN TONS OF NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES WHATEVER YOU HAVE AT HOME
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0086600_0086972 BUT IN THE COST THAT UH THE MANAGEMENT IS LOOKING FOR THAT'S NOT GONNA BE POSSIBLE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0087135_0087654 BUT IF IT'S TRENDY IF IT'S FANCY IT'S GOT SOME COLOUR TO IT IF IT'S VERY EASY EASY TO USE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0087654_0088117 IF IT'S GOT SIMPLE REMOTE SPEECH REMOTE UH CONTROL LIKE I SAID
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0088117_0088647 LOUDER SOFTER CHANGE CHANNEL ON OFF REMOTE IT GOES BEEP BEEP
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0088647_0089130 I CAN FIND MY MY REMOTE WITHOUT SPENDING HALF A DAY LOOKING FOR IT AND GETTING ALL UPSET 'CAUSE I CAN'T TURN THE T. V. ON
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0089243_0090032 SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A IN THIS GLOBAL IDEA WITH THE IDEAS OF THE INDUSTRIAL UH DESIGN
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0090111_0090310 BUT PRICE OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0092079_0092188 SPEECH RECOGNITION
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0103143_0103181 MM
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0104117_0104875 BECAUSE THA W WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION UH TH I'M NOT THAT GOOD AT THAT IDEA BUT TH
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0104877_0105519 IF IT'S A ONE WORD RECOGNITION 'CAUSE I KNOW WITH TELEPHONES AND CARS AND THINGS I'VE SEEN IN THE STATES
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0105519_0105835 A FRIEND OF MINE SAYS CALL MOM AND IT CALLS UP MOM
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0105917_0106084 'KAY THE RADIO CAN BE ON AND EVERYTHING
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0106168_0107042 BECAUSE I THINK S WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION IF UH THE THE REMOTE OR LIKE THE TELEPHONE IT HAS A EXACT WORD THAT IT HAS TO HEAR
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0107108_0107375 I DON'T THINK IT WOULD COME THROUGH A SENTENCE IN A TELEVISION
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0107385_0107877 IF SOMEBODY'S SPEAKING ON THE SE THE TELEVISION THEY'RE NOT GONNA STOP AND SAY REMOTE OKAY
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0107913_0108392 SO I THINK THAT UH SOMETHING COULD BE DESIGNED TO RECOGNISE SINGLE WORD
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0108457_0108607 LIKE THE T LIKE THE TELEPHONE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0108649_0109082 NO BECAUSE I THIS IS THIS IS YEARS AGO IN THE UNITED STATES WHERE WE'RE DRIVING DOWN AND HE SAID CALL HOME
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0109082_0109538 AND THE TELEPHONE CALLED IMMEDIATELY SO WELL THAT'S KINDA CUTE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0116433_0116946 FROM FROM YOUR SIDE UH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO BACK THE MANAGEMENT AND S BE MORE S PRECISE
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0116946_0117054 WHAT DO THEY WANT
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0117054_0117352 UH A RISK TAKE A RISK ON THE MARKET
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0117352_0117842 SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA COST MORE BUT COULD VERY EASILY S MAKE A BOOM IN THE MARKET
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0117908_0118231 BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT HAS TO BE TOTAL TOTALLY NEW
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0118231_0118405 SOMETHING THAT NOBODY HAS RIGHT NOW
AMI_IS1008b_H03_MIE085_0118496_0118579 AND IT'S GONNA COST

AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0046126_0046418 WHY WAS THE PLASTIC ELIMINATED AS A POSSIBLE MATERIAL
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0046867_0046902 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0048246_0048290 WHIC
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0048469_0048626 WHICH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0049368_0049523 ALTHOUGH I THINK
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0049692_0050161 I THINK WITH WOOD THOUGH YOU'D RUN INTO THE SAME TYPES OF PROBLEMS WOULDN'T YOU I MEAN IT CHIPS
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0050161_0050807 IT IF YOU DROP IT UH IT'S I'M NOT SU
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0051174_0051749 I THINK IF YOU RE IF YOU USE REALLY GOOD QUALITY WOOD THEN IT MIGHT WORK BUT YOU CAN'T JUST USE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0052112_0052258 YEAH EXACTLY YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0054294_0054351 THE STAIN
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0055872_0056408 UM IN TERMS OF COMMENTS ON THIS OR IN TERMS OF MY OWN
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0057137_0057255 Y YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0057796_0058698 I THINK WE CAN GET THE QUALITY MATERIALS THEN IT SHOULDN'T INFLUENCE THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES TOO MUCH WHICH YOU'LL SEE WITH MY PRESENTATION
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0058698_0059750 ONE THING WE'D HAVE TO CHECK THOUGH IS WHAT THE USERS WHETHER HOW QUICKLY THE NOVELTY WEARS OFF OF HAVING UH YEAH FOR EXAMPLE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0059750_0060371 SO HAVE TO SEE HOW KID FRIENDLY IT IS AND AND ALL THAT BUT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0061964_0061984 SURE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0063942_0064042 ONE POINT THREE YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0064237_0064295 UH YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0064422_0064500 I THINK SO YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0064696_0064826 YEAH THAT'S THE ONE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0064826_0064980 SO IT'S A VERY SHORT PRESENTATION
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0064980_0065628 'CAUSE I'M ACTUALLY GONNA DRAW YOU THE LAYOUT ON THE BOARD SO IF YOU WANT TO JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE SECOND SLIDE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0065628_0065833 UM WHICH BASICALLY SHOWS
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0065833_0066825 SORT OF I TOOK THE IDEAS THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST TIME UM AND TRIED TO PUT THAT INTO THE REMOTE CONTROL SO THE THINGS THAT Y YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE ON IT ARE THE ON OFF SWITCH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0066825_0067537 VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL THE MENU ACCESS BUTTON ERGONOMIC SHAPE WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH CHRISTINE'S IDEA TO HAVE IT SORT OF MOLDED
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0067537_0068115 SO IT'S SLIGHTLY MORE ERGONOMIC AND COMFORTABLE TO HOLD THAN THE R STANDARD VERY STRAIGHT REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0068115_0068785 AND ACTUALLY THE OTHER THING WITH THE WOOD IF WE TAKE YOUR CUSTOMISING IDEA IS THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY DO SORT OF QUASI MEASUREMENTS ON THEIR HAND SIZE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0068785_0069170 SO IF SOMEONE HAS LARGER HANDS YOU HAVE A WIDER REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0069344_0069728 SO THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD IDEA FOR CUSTOMI CUSTOMISABILITY
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0069728_0070336 UM ONE THING I THOUGHT MIGHT BE KIND OF INTERESTING IS TO PUT A FLIP SCREEN ON IT JUST LIKE YOU HAVE ON FLIP PHONES
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0070336_0070916 SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THIS CASE WHERE SOMEONE SITS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL OR ACCIDENTALLY PUTS THEIR HAND ON IT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0070916_0071675 ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE LITTLE KIDS AROUND THEY'RE NOT PRESSING THE BUTTONS WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO WATCH A T. V. SHOW AND ACCIDENTALLY CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR TURN IT OFF
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0071675_0072038 AND ALSO UM YOU HAD ISSUES WITH THE BATTERIES RUNNING OUT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0072038_0072769 SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD PUT A LITTLE BATTERY LIFE LIGHT ON IT THAT KIND OF GOES DIMMER AND DIMMER AND DIMMER AS YOUR BATTERY IS STARTS TO DIE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0072769_0073744 AND IN TERMS OF INVISIBLE FEATURES AUDIO AND UM TACTILE FEEDBACK ON BUTTON PRESSES AND LIKE YOU SAID SPEECH RECOGNITION
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0073744_0074110 SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS THING WOULD ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0074353_0074824 DESPITE WORKING IN INTERFACE DESIGN I'M NOT THE GREATEST ARTIST IN THE WORLD SO YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE ME
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0075093_0075676 YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITH AN ON OFF SWITCH FAIRLY BIG SORT OF IN THE CORNER AND BY ITSELF
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0075676_0076118 SO YOU DON'T ACCIDENTALLY TURN YOUR T. V. OFF WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO MANOEUVRE OTHER BUTTONS
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0076118_0076561 AND THEN YOU HAVE SORT OF ONE OF THOSE TOGGLE DISPLAYS FOR OOPS
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0076680_0077144 CHANNELS AND VOLUME SORT OF FOR SURFING CHANNELS AND THEN VOLUME
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0077144_0077780 SO THE VOLUME WOULD BE THE UP AND DOWN 'CAUSE VOLUME GOES UP AND DOWN AND THEN CHANNELS LEFT TO RIGHT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0077780_0078173 AND THEN HERE YOU'D HAVE YOUR SORT OF STANDARD TELEPHONISH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0078285_0078361 NUMBER PAD
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0078637_0079708 AND THEN ON ONE SIDE YOU WOULD HAVE AN ACCESS TO THE MENU ON YOUR T. V. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE A WAY TO TURN OFF THE VOICE CONTROL
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0079708_0080440 SO THAT IF THE USER DOESN'T WANT TO USE THEIR VOICE THEY CAN JUST TURN IT OFF AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL ACCIDENTALLY CHANGING THINGS ON YOU
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0080568_0081012 UM SO AGAIN YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE L. C. D. LIGHT SOMEWHERE THE FLIP
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0081133_0081414 THING AND HAVE I FORGOTTEN ANYTHING
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0081603_0081741 I DON'T THINK SO
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0081741_0082271 SO AS YOU CAN SEE IT'S A VERY VERY SIMPLE DESIGN WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY WANTED TO KEEP
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0082271_0082775 IS KEEP IT SIMPLE NOT HAVE TOO MANY BUTTONS NOT HAVE TOO MANY FUNCTIONALITIES THROWN INTO IT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0082775_0083746 THINK THE DESIGN CAN PRETTY MUCH CARRY OVER TO EVERYTHING ALTHOUGH WITH THE WOOD THE FLIP SCREEN MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0083977_0084048 YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0084048_0084241 BUT YOU ALSO HAVE TO D START WATCHING OUT FOR THE WEIGHT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0084241_0084676 'CAUSE DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THE THE FLIP SCREEN WILL ADD TO THE WEIGHT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0084676_0084933 YOU DON'T WANT IT TO START GETTING TOO HEAVY
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0084933_0085425 BUT THAT'S THE GENERAL LAYOUT WITH THE GENERAL FUNCTIONALITIES IF WE COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0085425_0085999 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S STILL LOTS OF SPACE ON THE ACTUAL REMOTE CONTROL AND IF YOU DO IT CUSTOMISABLY
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0085999_0086569 YOU CAN MAKE THIS THING FAIRLY SMALL OR FAIRLY O LARGE DEPENDING ON PERSONAL PREFERENCES
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0086738_0087411 SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I HAD TO SAY I MEAN EVERYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF DESIGN ISSUES
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0087411_0087634 UM THE CENTERING OF THE KEY PAD AND
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0087765_0088682 THE CHANNEL IS JUST DEPENDING ON WHERE YOUR THUMB IS AND YOU TEND TO USE THE THE VOLUME CONTROL AND UH THE BROWSING MORE THAN THE ACTUAL NUMBER PAD
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0088682_0089134 SO THAT WOULD BE SORT OF IN DIRECT LINE OF WHERE YOUR THUMB GOES WHEN YOU ARE HOLDING THE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0089134_0089395 THE NUMBER PAD A LITTLE BIT LOWER 'CAUSE IT'S USED LESS FREQUENTLY
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0089514_0090182 SO ONCE WE DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE EXACT POSITIONING BUT MORE OR LESS I THINK IT SHOULD GO ALONG THOSE LINES
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0092151_0092179 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0093240_0093254 YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0098138_0098161 NO NO
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0105525_0105555 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0105958_0105988 YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0106925_0106952 RIGHT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0107366_0107799 ESPECIALLY YOU MIGHT NEED SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR TRAINING THE SPEECH RECOGNITION AND YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0108176_0108208 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0108735_0108764 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0111521_0111666 OH YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0111948_0112311 YEAH SO IT'S REALLY MOLDED TO TO YOUR SPECIFIC
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0113653_0114342 BUT TH FOR THAT YOU'D ALSO HAVE TO DO SORT OF AN AVERAGE ACROSS FAMILIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT IF UNLESS EVERYONE HAS THEIR OWN PERSONAL REMOTE
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0114663_0114939 THE SALES YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0115594_0115625 YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0115872_0116427 WELL ALREADY THE CUSTOMISABILITY IS A REALLY GOOD SORT OF NEW GIMMICK
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0116938_0116965 YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0117082_0117110 YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0117349_0117593 AND THAT TOOK OFF YEAH YEAH
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0118383_0118413 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0122279_0122307 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0124674_0124705 MM YEAH

AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0129383_0129414 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0129845_0130081 I THINK IT DEPENDS I MEAN I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0130081_0130905 BUT WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW USEFUL IT'S GONNA BE BECAUSE THEORETICALLY WITH THE T. V. YOU ALREADY HAVE A BIG DISPLAY RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0131024_0131628 SO IF WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP COSTS DOWN THEN MAYBE SACRIFICING THE DISPLAY
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0131818_0131934 IS A WAY TO GO
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0131934_0132570 I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH PUTTING A DISPLAY COSTS AND WHAT IT WOULD BE USED FOR VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT IT WOULD BE USED FOR
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0132570_0133048 'CAUSE IF IT'S ONLY USED FOR ONE LITTLE THING THEN PUTTING IN A BIG DISPLAY CASE OR A BIG DISPLAY THAT'S
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0133178_0134101 PROBABLY EXPENSIVE JUST TO DO THE TRAINING ON THE CHIP FOR THE SPEECH RECOGNITION OR WHATEVER MAY NOT BE THE MOST COST EFFICIENT WAY TO GO BUT
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0134236_0134416 THAT'S JUST SORT OF SPECULATION I MEAN
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0139929_0139957 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008c_H01_FIE038_0140426_0140597 WHAT ABOUT THE BUTTONS WOULD

AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0015810_0016190 IN INSTANCE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT USING SOME SORT OF SPEECH RECOGNITION
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0016190_0016731 YOU HAVE TO HAVE MICROPHONE WELL NO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY I HAVEN'T HAVE TO HAVE MICROPHONE IN THE DEVICE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0016731_0017574 BUT UM MAYBE YOU DO HAVE IT A A WAY IT HAS TO IT HAS TO HEAR THE SPEAKER AND UM
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0017574_0018095 SO IT COULD BE IN THE TELEVISION SET COULD BE IN THE DEVICE BUT SOMEWHERE YOU HAVE TO PUT THE MICROPHONE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0018095_0018713 UM AND A W A WAY OF MAKING BEEPS OR SOUNDS SO YOU CAN FIND IT WHEN IT'S GETS LOST
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0018713_0019053 UM SO THE OTHER W THING THAT WE SO
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0019053_0019714 OUR METHOD FOR GOING ABOUT THIS IS WE'VE LOOKED AT UH THE HISTO HI HISTORICAL RECORD WHAT'S WORKED
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0019714_0020646 WHAT HASN'T AND THEN WE ALSO UM WE WANTED TO EVALUATE SOME NEW MATERIALS AND WE CONTACTED MANUFACTURING FOR THEIR INPUT BECAUSE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0020646_0021385 COURSE WE M MIGHT COME UP AND CHOOSE THE MATERIAL THAT THEN MANUFACTURING DIDN'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGIES OR CAPABILITIES TO OFFER US
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0021385_0021848 SO UH THIS IS THE APPROACH THAT WE TOOK DURING OUR UM OUR RESEARCH
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0021989_0022935 SO UM FOR THE CASE UM WE TOLD WE WERE MAKING A SPECIFICA SPECIFIC ASSUMPTION THAT IT WOULD BE CURVED IN DESIGN
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0022935_0023316 COURSE YOU KNOW I WANTED IT TO BE EXPANDABLE AND SHRINKABLE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0023316_0024244 BUT UM THAT UH DOESN'T SEEM TO B BE ONE OF THE CHOIC NON OPTION WE CAN UH WE CAN REALLY SERIOUSLY EXPLORE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0024244_0024526 SO THEN WE WERE THINKING ABOUT UM RUBBER
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0024526_0025556 BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S BEEN ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF THE HEAT UH FACTOR AND TH UM THERE MIGHT BE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE M UH HOW IT'S
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0025682_0025870 UH GOES WITH THE BOARD
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0025955_0026687 UH AND UH THEN TH PLASTIC ALSO HAS THIS PROBLEM OF MELTING AND IT'S BRITTLE IT GETS BRITTLE AFTER A WHILE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0026687_0027661 SO UM WE STILL HAD TITANIUM AND AND WOOD AVAILABLE BUT UM UNFORTUNATELY UH UH TITANIUM'S ALSO BEEN ELIMINATED UH
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0027661_0028154 THE M PEOPLE IN MANUFACTURING SAID THAT YOU COULDN'T MAKE D CURVED CASES OUT OF TITANIUM
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0028154_0029120 ALTHOUGH HOW APPLE DID IT WITH TH POWERBOOK I'M NOT SU QUITE SURE BUT UH NEVERTHELESS UM THEY'VE ELIMINATED ALL OF OUR OPTIONS EXCEPT WOOD
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0029189_0029508 SO THIS IS OUR FINDING
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0029508_0029900 AND A AS SHE SAID IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY UH MATERIAL
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0029900_0030598 SO WE'RE WE'RE CURRENTLY UH PROPOSING UH WE'LL GET TO ALL MY PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN JUST A SECOND
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0030598_0031151 SO THEN THERE'S THIS OTHER MATTER OF THE CHIPS AND UM WELL WE COULD USE A SIMPLE DESIGN ON THE BOARD
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0031151_0031831 BUT UH THESE SIMPLE CHIPS BUT THAT'S ONLY WORKS FOR THE BU YOU DON'T GET VERY MUCH UM INTELLIGENCE WITH THIS SIMPLE ONE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0031831_0032848 AND UM THEN THERE WAS THE REGULAR WHICH I REGRET THAT I'VE FORGOTTEN EXACTLY WHY I'M ELIMINATING THAT ONE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0032848_0033291 UH THE OTHER OPTION WAS THIS ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0033291_0033845 AND UH WE LIKED TH WE WE FOUND THAT IT IT INCLUDES THIS INFRARED SENDER
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0033845_0034252 WHICH W 'MEMBER THE BEAM WAS THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF FINDING THE RIGHT CHIP
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0034308_0035458 AND UH MANUFACTURING HAS TOLD US THAT THEY'VE UM UH RECENTLY DEVELOPED A UH A SENSOR AND A SPEAKER THAT WOULD UH BE INTEGRATED INTO THIS ADVANCED CHIP ON PRINT
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0035458_0036288 SO UH WE WE UH NOW JUMPING RIGHT TO OUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES UM I I'D REALLY THINK WE SHOULD
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0036288_0036886 YOU KNOW USE SOME OF UH SOME REALLY EXOTIC WOODS LIKE UM YOU KNOW UH
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0036886_0037449 WELL YOU GUYS COME FROM TROPICAL COUNTRIES SO YOU CAN KINDA THINK OF SOME TREES AND SOME NICE WOODS
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0037449_0037979 I THINK THAT PEOPLE WILL MIGHT REALLY WANT TO DESIGN THEIR OWN CASES YOU SEE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0037979_0038426 THEY COULD DO SORT OF A THIS UM THREE DIMENSIONAL DESIGN ON THE INTERNET
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0038426_0038846 AND THEN THEY COULD SUBMIT THEIR ORDERS KINDA LIKE YOU SUBMIT A CUSTOM CAR ORDER YOU KNOW
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0038846_0039433 AND YOU CAN CHOOSE THE COLOUR AND THE SIZE OF THE WHEELS AND THE COLOURS OF THE LEATHER AND THINGS LIKE THAT
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0039433_0040260 AND THEN I UH THINK WE SHOULD GO WITH THE SOLAR CELLS AS WELL AS THE UM MICROPHONE AND SPEAKER ON THE ADVANCED CHIP
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0040260_0041413 SO THIS IS THE FINDINGS OF OUR RESEARCH AND MY RECOMMENDATIONS UM FOR THE NEW REMOTE CONTROL W UM WOULD BE TO HAVE UM HAVE IT BE MADE OUT OF WOOD
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0041413_0041573 DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THAT
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0041928_0042136 I'M NOT SURE HOW DO I OH I KNOW LET'S SEE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0042136_0042272 LET'S GO BACK UP HERE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0043100_0044056 I THINK IT'S UM UM A MULTIPLE UH CHIP DESIGN UM AND IT'S UH MAYBE PRINTED ON TO THE CIRCUIT BOARD
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0044213_0044688 UH I COULD FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THAT UH BEFORE THE NEXT FI NEXT MEETING
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0045272_0045527 I DON'T KNOW BUT I'LL FIND OUT MORE AT OUR NEXT MEETING

AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0120945_0122215 SO ACTUALLY YOU COULD TURN IT Y TURN AROUND AND SAY THAT YOU'RE UH PAR THE REASON THE COST IS HIGH FOR THE DEVICE IS BECAUSE UM YOU'RE PAYING A A WORKING WAGE TO THE PERSON WHO MADE THE DEVICE
AMI_IS1008c_H02_FIE073_0122811_0122928 COST OF LIVING IS LOW

AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0052636_0052799 THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY INNOVATIVE IDEA
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0053569_0054189 WELL IT'S ACTUALLY A VERY INNOVATIVE N DIFFERENT IDEA THAT UH YOU KNOW YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR COLOUR OF WOOD YOUR TYPE OF WOOD
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0054320_0055158 I MEAN IT'S EACH PERSON IS GONNA HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALISED INDIVIDUALISED SPEECH RECOGNITION REMOTE CONTROL IN WOOD THAT'S NOT ON THE MARKET

AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0094430_0094681 THERE SHOULD ONLY BE ONE IN HERE
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0094681_0094750 TREND WATCH
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0095484_0095722 IT'S BEING MODIFIED
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0095722_0095833 THEY'RE STEALING OUR PRODUCT
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0095990_0096755 WE'VE BEEN GIVING SIMPLE QUESTIONNAIRES IN DIFFERENT AREAS BECAUSE TH OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT THE COM CONSUMERS ARE LOOKING FOR TODAY
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0096755_0097096 'CAUSE UH TRENDS CHANGE VERY VERY QUICKLY
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0097096_0097784 IN SIX MONTHS MAYBE THIS IDEA IS ALREADY GONE OUT THE WINDOW SO IT'S GONNA BE A QUESTION HOW FAST WE CAN ACT
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0097784_0098007 UH THEY ALREADY ERASED THE REST OF MINE HUH
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0098215_0098339 NO NO NO NO
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0098512_0098702 'CAUSE I HAD ANOTHER COMMENT THERE
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0098702_0098923 UH THE MARKET TREND
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0098923_0099543 THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW FROM THE LAST UH FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRES FROM THE THE ALL THE P SURVEYS WE'VE DONE
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0099543_0100058 FANCY AND FEEL GOOD THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT FEELS GOOD IN THE HAND THAT'S EASY TO USE
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0100058_0100547 LOOKING FOR NEXT GENERATION OF INNOVATION BECAUSE ALL THE REMOTES OUT THERE NOW THEY'RE ALL VERY SIMILAR
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0100547_0100928 THEY ALL DO THE SAME THING WE HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0100928_0100999 OKAY
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0100999_0101799 EASY TO USE HAS ALWAYS HAS BECOME HAS BECOME ANOTHER MAJOR INTEREST THAT UH WITH THE WHITEBOARD WE CAN SEE THAT IT'S A REMOTE THAT'S EASY TO USE
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0101942_0102531 AND I THINK THIS IS ANOTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING IS THE CONSUMERS ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE FOR EXCITING TEL TECHNOLOGY
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0102531_0103533 SO EVEN IF WE HAVE A PRODUCT THAT MAY BE MORE EXPENSIVE IF IT COMES OUT RIGHT IF THEY LOOK IT LOOKS AND FEELS GOOD AND HAS TECHNOLOGY
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0103533_0104063 THE SECOND TWO YOU CAN SEE THE LAST ONE IS A VERY EASY SIMPLE DESIGN
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0104063_0104708 THE SECOND ONE THERE IS ABOUT UH FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT BUTTONS ON IT WHICH MAKES IT FAIRLY HARD TO READ UH VERY HARD TO USE
AMI_IS1008c_H03_MIE085_0104708_0105027 THE FIRST ONE I SEE THAT THEY PUT IN A DISPLAY

AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0122258_0122568 WOULD IT BE THE CHRISTMAS SEASON BY ANY CHANCE
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0122568_0122718 SPORTS SEASON
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0122846_0122960 WHICH SPORT SEASON
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0123083_0123243 SO SO

AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0123861_0124778 SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS PERHAPS TO SYNCHRONISE THE FINAL THE THE LAUNCH OF A USER TESTED DEVICE WITH SOME SPECIAL EVENT
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0124778_0125353 AND AND THEN UM SO THAT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE TIME PERHAPS THEN WE ANTICIPATED
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0125353_0125777 BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN THE WORLD CUP IS BUT I'M SURE THERE'S GONNA BE ONE
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0125929_0126131 OR ANOTHER M MAJOR SPORTS EVENT
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0126131_0126533 PROBABLY NOT THE UM THE FOOTBALL GAMES COMING UP THE END OF JANUARY
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0126533_0126963 I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE UM BUT SO
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0126963_0128496 I'M JUST IG UH POINTING OUT A UH A STRATEGY TO UH DO SOME ADDITIONAL USER TESTING PRI AND THEN TO LAUNCH UM AT A A MAJOR SPORTS EVENT OR UH PERHAPS TO UH ALSO

AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0128824_0129886 THERE MIGHT BE SOME MOTION PICTURES THAT ARE COMING OUT UM THAT ARE COMING OUT ON D. V. D. THAT UH THEY NEED TO HAVE A M SPECIAL REMOTE CONTROL TO WORK WITH IT
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0129886_0130397 SO WE COULD MAYBE WORK OUT A CAMPAIGN WITH UH WITH SONY PICTURES FOR EXAMPLE
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0130397_0130822 MAYBE SOME MANAGEMENT HAS GOT UH RELATIONSHIPS THERE WE CAN LEVERAGE

AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0133084_0133416 DISPOSABLE DIAPERS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IN FACT
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0133416_0134281 YES IT IS ONE OF THE FIRST CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT WAS LAUNCHED ABOUT THIRTY YEARS THAT WAS A DISPOSABLE CONSUMER PRODUCT
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0134281_0134994 AND UH PEOPLE THE MARKET HADN'T REALLY GOTTEN ON TO THE CONCEPT THAT YOU COULD USE SOMETHING AND THEN THROW IT AWAY
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0134994_0135785 'CAUSE IT WASN'T UH BUT THEN WHEN THEY RE LAUNCHED THEM THIRTY YEARS LATER THEY WERE VIRTUALLY THE SAME DESIGN BUT PEOPLE HAD GOTTEN THE THROW AWAY YOU KNOW
AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0135785_0136363 PAPER CUPS AND NAPKI Y ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY HADN'T UM SO

AMI_IS1008d_H01_FIE073_0136909_0136969 THAT'S RIGHT

AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0003819_0003928 THANKS
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0009581_0009657 MM OKAY
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0009925_0010657 I'VE DONE A PRESENTATION BUT IT PRETTY MUCH COVERS WORK THAT WE'VE BOTH DONE SO IF I'M MISSING ANYTHING CHRISTINE CAN JUST CORRECT ME
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0011389_0011711 IT'S NOT THE BIGGEST POWERPOINT PRESENTATION IN THE WORLD BUT
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0011988_0012006 THREE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0012615_0012718 UM
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0012854_0013109 NO IT'S THINK IT'S THE LAST ONE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0013269_0013704 NO THEN THIS IS THE LA YEAH THAT ONE FINAL DESIGN
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0013704_0014122 IT IS NAMED APPROPRIATELY YOU JUST COULDN'T SEE THE NAME
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0014122_0014328 UM OKAY CAN I HAVE THE MOUSE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0014522_0014566 THANKS
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0014784_0014902 ALRIGHT SO
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0015138_0015801 FROM WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING SPECIFYING THE CASE IN THE LAST MEETING WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED AN ERGONOMIC SHAPE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0015801_0016480 THE MATERIAL THAT WE CHOSE WAS WOOD AND UH THE COLOUR WOULD BE CUSTOMISABLE 'CAUSE YOU CAN STAIN THE WOOD WHATEVER COLOUR
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0016590_0017086 UM SO IN TERMS OF FUNCTION YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE T. V. ON AND OFF
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0017086_0017442 VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROL MENU CONTROL VOICE RECOGNITION CONTROL
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0017442_0017895 AND WE'VE INCORPORATED THE L. C. D. SCREEN ON THE FLIP PANEL AS PART OF THE DESIGN
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0017895_0018251 IF WE FIGURE OUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE WELL THEN YOU JUST TAKE IT OFF
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0018251_0018341 UM SO
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0018443_0018696 TO UNVEIL OUR LOVELY PRODUCT
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0019007_0019488 THIS IS OUR REMOTE CONTROL WITH THE FLIP PANEL AS YOU CAN SEE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0019554_0020135 SO IF YOU LIFT UP THE PANEL YOU CAN SEE THE LOVELY YELLOW L. C. D. DISPLAY
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0020135_0020388 UM THIS IS ACTUALLY HARD TO DO
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0020388_0020790 THE YELLOW BUTTON YOU HAVE IS THE ON OFF BUTTON SO IT'S REALLY BIG HARD TO MISS
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0020839_0021512 YOU HAVE THE THE RED UM TRIANGLES ARE THE TOGGLES FOR CHANGING THE VOLUME
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0021512_0021830 SO UP VOLUME UP DOWN VOLUME DOWN
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0021830_0022036 THE GREEN ARE THE CHANNEL CHANGING
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0022051_0022387 S AND IT'S ONE OF THOSE VERY LIGHT VERY TOUCHABLE DISPLAYS
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0022443_0023483 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE NUMERIC PAD IN THE DARK BLUE AT THE BOTTOM AND ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE YOU HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE MENU ON THE T. V.
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0023483_0024241 AND ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE YOU HAVE THE THE THE ABILITY TO TURN OFF THE VOICE RECOGNITION
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0024241_0024565 SO THIS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE HAD ON THE WHITE BOARD THE LAST TIME
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0024977_0024993 SO
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0025143_0025329 OH YES
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0025329_0026185 ADDITIONAL FEATURE ON THE BACK IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN CUSTOMISED BACKING AND I SUPPOSE YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING ON THE FLIP CASE ON THE FRONT
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0026185_0026533 SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY MAKE THIS A HIGHLY HIGHLY CUSTOMISABLE REMOTE CONTROL
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0027999_0028024 YEAH
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0029802_0030582 BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE UNDER THE FLIP EITHER BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE THE REMOTE CONTROL CLOSED BUT YOU STILL MIGHT WANT TO ACTIVATE IT BY VOICE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0032472_0032843 BUT IF YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE REMOTE CONTROL IN YOUR HAND YOU NEED TO OPEN THE FLIP TO USE THE VOICE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0032843_0033132 WHY USE THE VOICE WHY NOT JUST USE YOUR HAND
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0033132_0033694 I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT OF THE VOICE IS THAT IF THE REMOTE CONTROL IS SITTING THERE AND I'M TOO LAZY TO REACH OVER AND PICK IT UP
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0033694_0033866 I CAN JUST USE MY VOICE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0034460_0034471 YEAH
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0034471_0034838 AND YOU DON'T WANNA LET GO OF EITHER ONE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0035013_0035293 I MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ON THE FLIP IT CAN BE ON THE SIDE SOMEWHERE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0035349_0035390 YEAH
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0035522_0035868 SO I MEAN I CAN PASS THIS AROUND IF ANYONE WANTS TO
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0036713_0036779 YEAH
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0037245_0037345 YEAH EXACTLY
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0038574_0038822 YES
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0038822_0039435 AND MAYBE THE SHAPE OF THE BUTTONS THE LITTLE EGG SHAPES AREN'T THE MOST ECONOMICAL BUT
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0039890_0039973 YEAH
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0039973_0040095 I MEAN THIS IS PLASTICENE
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0040095_0040232 THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0040232_0040469 WE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY MADE IT A LOT THINNER AS WELL
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0040531_0040638 BUT
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0040755_0041135 AND PART OF THE THING IS M A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY DON'T LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S TOO LIGHT
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0041135_0041393 BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE ENOUGH CONTROL OVER IT
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0041393_0042008 SO I MEAN MAYBE THIS IS EXCESSIVELY HEAVY BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO HAVE SOME WEIGHT IT NEEDS TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE STILL HOLDING SOMETHING
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0042207_0042689 SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT FOR OUR PRESENTATION ACTUALLY

AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0103508_0103548 MM-HMM
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0103725_0104672 THINK MINIMUM TWO WEEKS IF WE'RE GONNA DEVELOP PROTOTYPES AND THEN TRY TO TAKE THEM TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND SEE HOW PEOPLE USE IT'S NOT A TRIVIAL TASK
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0104992_0105079 NO NO

AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0110504_0110691 THIS IS BAD WE WANT THIS DONE DIFFERENTLY
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0113772_0114461 THE PROBLEM IS THERE MIGHT NOT BE A SECOND GENERATION IF THE FIRST GENERATION FLOPS FOR SOME SILLY REASON THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF

AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0115307_0116553 BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELEASING A PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN MINIMALLY TESTED AND FINE TUNED TO SUIT A GENERAL RANGE OF REQUIREMENTS VERSUS RELEASING A PRODUCT THAT WE THINK WILL WORK BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING TO BACK IT UP
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0116961_0117200 YES BUT I'M NOT EVERYBODY
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0117200_0117621 I MEAN THE WHOLE POINT OF USER EVALUATION IS TO SEE WHAT REAL PEOPLE NEED
AMI_IS1008d_H02_FIE038_0117621_0118156 WE HAVE OUR OWN MOTIVATIONS IN MIND WE HAVE OUR OWN IDEAS IN MIND BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA SELL

AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0044100_0044724 NOW IT GOES INTO THIS NEXT PHASE AS THE FINANCIAL UH MARKETING UH
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0052292_0052744 WELL WE HAVEN'T COME TO MINE YET SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION YES
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0053948_0054586 WELL IT JUST DEPENDS ON IF WE'RE GONNA ADD A O ON THIS PR
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0054755_0055204 PROVISIONARY COST ANALYSIS WE DO NOT HAVE A L. C. DISPLAY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0055204_0055457 L. C. DISPLAY IS GONNA BE VERY EXPENSIVE IT'S GONNA BE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0055601_0055673 IT'S NOT IT DOESN'T SAY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0055673_0056310 WE DON'T HAVE THE PRICE UP THERE OKAY SO IF WE ADD APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE EURO PER
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0056499_0057455 REMOTE NOW WE'RE UP AROUND ABOUT TWELVE TWELVE AND A HALF AS TO WHAT UH THE COMPANY HAD INITIALLY UH REQUESTED
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0057455_0057489 UM

AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0057853_0058575 BUT AS FAR AS PRODUCTION UM I'M PUTTING UP A QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROFIT ALSO AND IN MINE YOU'LL SEE UH
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0058690_0059128 THE PROBLEM WITH UH OUR SURVEY THE P THE POSSIBILITY THAT HOW MANY UNITS CAN BE SOLD
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0059128_0059658 WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET ETCETERA ETCETERA BECAUSE THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN IN INTO CONSIDERATION
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0059771_0060454 UH THIS IS JUST PRODUCTION COST IT IS NOT UH ADVERTISING COST IT'S NOT TRANSPORTATION COST UH
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0060691_0061466 AND THAT WILL INFLATE QUITE A BIT THE COST OF THE UH THE COST OF THE UNIT FOR THE COMPANY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0061466_0062116 SO TO COME UP WITH WHAT THE COMPANY WANTS IS A FIFTY MILLION POUND PROFIT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO A LONG WAYS
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0062309_0062394 YES
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0062990_0063041 SLIGHTLY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0063645_0063878 IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD TO REDUCE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0065230_0065490 THAT'S NOT BAD
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0069004_0069241 IF WE CAN GO TO TO MY DISPLAY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0069358_0069790 AND WE'LL COME BACK TO YOURS JUST TO GIVE EVERYBODY AN IDEA OF THE MARKET
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0070151_0070538 SO NOW I'M GONNA SCARE EVERYBODY OUT OF THIS PROJECT
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0070844_0071186 IF I'M STILL HERE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0071186_0071208 YEP
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0071349_0071730 THE FOUR GIVES ME IT'S GOTTA BE UH TRENDWATCH
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0071992_0072011 NO
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0072259_0072502 IT SHOULDN'T BE IF IT'S NOT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT ONE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0072502_0072676 NO NO WE G NO THAT'S THE SAME ONE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0072676_0072809 YOU HAVE TO GO BACK AND FIND ANOTHER ONE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0073383_0073533 WHATEVER NAME IT POPPED UP UNDER
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0073695_0074115 UH FUNCTIONAL TRY FUNCTIONAL IT MIGHT NOT BE IT EITHER BUT WE'LL SEE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0074455_0074538 YEP THAT'S IT
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0074538_0074733 SO WE'LL GO SCREEN BY SCREEN
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0074733_0075801 ALTHOUGH SINCE UH WE NEED TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF IDEA ON A MARKET UH WE HAD INDEPENDENT STUDY THAT SAYS IT THIS THIS MARKET HAS AN AVAILABILITY TO ABSORB EIGHT MI EIGHT MILLION UNITS PER YEAR
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0075801_0075919 OKAY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0075919_0076497 OUR INTERNAL COMPANY EVALUATION PUTS IT BETWEEN EIGHT TO NINE MILLION WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AS THE INDEPENDENT STUDY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0076611_0076976 SO IF WE CONTINUE WE'LL LOOK AT THE FINDINGS
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0076976_0077043 NEXT SCREEN
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0077312_0078011 WHICH MEANS THAT UH IF WE HAVE A TARGET OF TWO MILLION WOULD THE COMPANY HAS TO TAKE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET IN THE FIRST YEAR
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0078011_0078144 WHICH IS ACTUALLY A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0078300_0078383 NO KIDDING YEAH
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0078564_0079296 SO IF WE PUT AN INFLATED PRICE OF FIFTY EURO AT A PRODUCTION COST THAT CANNOT EXCEED TWENTY FIVE EURO
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0079296_0079697 OKAY WE'RE ALREADY IN THAT THAT PRICE OKAY WITH TRANSPORT
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0079697_0080157 PROMOTION LABOUR BECAUSE WE HAV GI INCLUDED THE PROMOTION IN THE COST
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0080157_0080817 TRANSPORT FOR THE MATERIAL TO THE STORES OR WHATEVER HOW HOWEVER WE'RE GONNA BREAK THIS DOWN BETWEEN OUR OUR RETAILERS
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0080896_0081222 TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE MARKET TO GET TO TWO MILLION UNITS
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0081222_0081910 AT TWO MILLION UNITS WE HAVE TO HAVE A PROFIT OF TWENTY FIVE EURO PER UNIT TO GET TO THE FIFTY MILLION UNIT EU EURO PROFIT
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0081910_0081960 OKAY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0082108_0082546 SO OBVIOUSLY WE W W I JUST DID A RUN DOWN THE EVALUATION OF THE FORM
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0082546_0083258 THE FAN UH THE FANCY STYLISHNESS OF THE OF THE UNIT THE EASE OF USE SPEECH RECOGNITION COST WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0083258_0083947 NOW THE COMPANY MUST EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO TAKE ENOUGH OF THE MARKET TO JUSTIFY IN PRODUCTION
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0084059_0084542 OR WE PROJECT THIS OVER TWO YEARS BUT BEING THAT THE MARKET CHANGES VERY VERY QUICKLY
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0084542_0084895 MAYBE THERE'S NO MORE INTEREST IN BUYING THIS THING IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS FROM NOW
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0084895_0085138 SO NOW WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A DECISION
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0085138_0085368 CAN THE COMPANY SELL TWO MILLION UNITS
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0085368_0085622 CAN IT SELL IT FOR FIFTY EUROS

AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0097610_0097922 MAYBE THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF SELLING MORE THAN TWO MILLION UNITS IN ONE YEAR
AMI_IS1008d_H03_MIE085_0097922_0098545 WHICH COULD YOU KNOW FEASIBILI FEASIBILITY UH LOWER THE PRICE OF THE UNIT

AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0116741_0117421 BASICALLY I'M I'M NOT VERY TECHNICAL UH UH EDUCATED BUT UH I COULD FIGURE IT OUT
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0117421_0118416 UM BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS YOU PRESS A BUTTON UH THEN A CIRCUIT GETS CLOSED BY PRESSING THE BUTTON UH LIKE A SWITCH
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0118466_0119055 AND BY CLOSING THAT CERTAIN CIRCUIT THE CHIP KNOWS UH WHAT BU BUTTON IS PRESSED
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0119055_0119816 SO LIKE YOU PRESS A ONE THAT CIRCUIT IS CLOSED AND UH THEN THE CHIP PRODUCES A PATTERN
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0119973_0120695 LIKE A MORSE CODE TO UH AND AND SENDS THAT TO THE UH L. E. D.
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0120695_0121252 THAT'S THE UH LIGHT EMITTING DIODE I THINK
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0121252_0121822 UM AND THE LIGHT EMITTING DIODE IS UH PRODUCING INFRARED LIGHT
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0121822_0122040 THAT'S UN UH INVISIBLE
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0122159_0122325 TO THE HUMAN EYE

AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0122828_0123679 HOWEVER IT HAS ALSO AN UH A VISIBLE UH DIODE THAT'S UH BLINKING RED IF YOU LOOK IN IT
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0123679_0124041 AND THAT'S UH ANOTHER DIODE I BELIEVE
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0124041_0124259 BECAUSE INFRARED IS NOT VISIBLE
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0124259_0124651 SO THAT'S ER UH DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BUT
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0124792_0124858 YEAH

AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0135036_0135116 THAT ARE WORKING
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0135340_0135642 YEAH OR I DUNNO HOW IT'S UH EXACTLY HOW IT WORKS
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0135642_0135784 IT WASN'T EXPLAINED THERE
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0136994_0137037 YEAH
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0137212_0137264 OKAY

AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0139239_0139307 OKAY
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0139616_0139762 OKAY YEAH
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0139762_0140213 SO IT UH WE HAVE TO MAKE A A S A BIT MORE INTELLIGENT CHIP THAN THE STANDARD ONE
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0140213_0140432 BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO YEAH
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0140828_0140941 UH OKAY

AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0141140_0141563 THAT'S UH WHEN THE CIRCUIT IS CLOSED IT PRODUCES THE PATTERN
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0141563_0142188 BUT UH MA BASICALLY FOR UH BRANDS OF T. V. THESE PATTERNS ARE DIFFERENT
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0142229_0142596 SO LIKE WHEN YOU PRESS A ONE ON ONE T. V. IT GO GO TO ONE
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0142596_0142848 AND ON THE OTHER T. V. IT WON'T WORK BASICALLY
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0142890_0143497 SO UH BASICALLY WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO IS UH GET THESE PATTERNS RIGHT
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0143497_0144401 AND UH BY D UH THAT CAN BE DONE BY UH JUST UH CHA YEAH CHANGING THIS PATTERN ALL THE TIME
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0144401_0144555 AND UM
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0144657_0145369 WHAT HE'S DOING WHEN HE'S CONFIGURING THIS PATTERN THIS CHIP UH IS TRYING TO SWITCH OFF THE TELEVISION
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0145369_0146396 AND WHEN IT'S UH SWITCHED OFF YOU CAN PUSH A BUTTON AS UH IT'S WORKING NOW SO AND THEN HE SAVES THAT SETTING AND THEN UM IT'S WORKING
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0146536_0146586 OKAY

AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0147990_0148516 UM THE ENERGY SOURCE IS UH THE BATTERY BASICALLY
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0148516_0148894 UM THAT'S CONNECTING TO ALL THE COMPONENTS
AMI_TS3004b_H02_MTD014ID_0149018_0149425 BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE FED WITH ENERGY

AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0025442_0026335 I SEARCHED THE WEB UH AND UH I SEARCHED UH ON THIS D DOCUMENT RECENT INVESTIGATION OF THE REMOTE CONTROL MARKET
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0026335_0026669 IT HAS BEEN DONE IN ITALY UH ITALY AND IN
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0026820_0027186 UH ANOTHER COUNTRY IN EUROPE I FORGET IT
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0027186_0028041 UH BUT UH THEY FOUND OUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR REMOTE CONTROLS HAPPENS TO BE A FANCY LOOK AND FEEL INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FUNCTIONAL LOOK AND FEEL
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0028041_0028345 SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0028345_0028988 SO WHAT MICHAEL JUST SAID IT MUST BE UH SOME VERY DIFFERENT FROM ORDINARY UH REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0029014_0029487 FANCY STANDS FOR AN ORIGINAL LOOK AND FEEL OF THE CASE AND INTERFACE
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0029623_0029881 UH THIS UH ASPECT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0029881_0030095 UH IT CAME OUT OF THE RESEARCH
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0030095_0030420 IT UH IS TWICE IMPORTANT AS THE FOLLOWING
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0030420_0031043 THE SECOND UH MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT IS THAT A REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD IT UH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIVE
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0031102_0031499 UH THAT STANDS FOR UH UH NEW TECHNICAL UH FEATURES
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0031499_0032614 AND THEN UH THAT UH THIS IS A POINT OF DISCUSSION BECAUSE WE JUST DECIDED THAT WE DON'T MAKE USE OF UH L. C. D. OR UH SPEECH RECOGNITION
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0032664_0033823 BUT UM THIS IS THE SECOND UH IMPORTANT UH ASPECT AND I THINK UH WE MUST USE SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO BE UH INNOVATIVE
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0034043_0034269 UH MAYBE MAYBE SOMETHING NEW
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0034269_0035050 WE HAVE TO DISCUSS ABOUT IT S UH OKAY UH FEATURES NOT UH DO NOT EXIST IN CURRENT REMOTE CONTROLS
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0035050_0035206 AND THAT'S VERY HARD I THINK
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0035308_0035715 UH THE THIRD ONE IS THE ASPECT OF THE REMOTE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASY TO USE
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0035715_0036010 BUT UH THAT WAS AN OVERALL UH POINT
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0036010_0036240 WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THAT
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0036240_0036608 UM I'VE GOT ONE PICTURE

AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0037430_0038353 AND IT SAYS UH FASHION WATCHERS OF UH UH PARI UH FRANCE AND UH ITALY YEAH UH HAVE DETECTED THE FOLLOWING TRENDS
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0038436_0039076 THIS TRENDS I TH UH TREND I THINK IT'S NOT UM THAT MEANINGFUL FOR US MAYBE
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0039076_0039442 BUT IT'S ABOUT UH CLOTHES AND SHOES
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0039442_0040283 BUT THE UH THE NEXT UH ASPECT ALSO IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR THE FEEL OF MATERIAL IS EXPE UH UH IS EXPECTED TO BE SPONGY
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0040283_0040636 BUT SPONGY WHAT WHAT DOES SPONGY SAYS

AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0045197_0045889 UH BECAUSE A FANCY LOOK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING UH FOR REMOTE CONTROL UH CONTROL I THINK ABOUT CHANGEABLE FRONTS
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0046011_0046386 UH MAYBE A SEE THROUGH ONE IN A A FRUIT FRONT
AMI_TS3004c_H03_MTD016ME_0046386_0046584 BECAUSE IT'S UH IT'S HOT
