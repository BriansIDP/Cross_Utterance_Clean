"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003057_0003385.lab"
WELL

GOT
A
BROWSER
NOW
WHICH
WHOOPS
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003385_0003440.lab"
ALREADY
GONE
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0003634_0003660.lab"
MM-HMM
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0004091_0004413.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0004872_0004902.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005038_0005142.lab"
SO
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005142_0005935.lab"
WE'VE
GO
A
BROWSER
WE'VE
UM
WHICH
COMES
UP
AUTOMATICALLY
WITH
A
TRANSCRIPTION
BOX
AND
THE
TOPICS
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0005935_0006681.lab"
AND
THEN
WHEN
YOU
GO
ON
THE
MENU
YOU
CAN
SELECT
A
SUMMARISATION
BOX
WHICH
POPS
UP
AND
AN
AUDIO
PLAYER
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0006879_0007304.lab"
UM
AND
A
S
I
THINK
THE
SEARCH
WORKS
AS
WELL
SO
YOU
COULD
POP
UP
A
SEARCH
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007304_0007975.lab"
AND
IT
LOADS
UP
UM
JUST
THE
BACKGROUND
WINDOW
IS
EMPTY
AND
UM
SO
WHEN
YOU
START
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0007975_0008475.lab"
YOU
HAVE
TO
EITHER
OPEN
OPEN
A
PARTICULAR
OBSERVATION
OR
DO
A
SEARCH
AND
OPEN
IT
THROUGH
THAT
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008648_0008707.lab"
DOES
THAT
MAKE
SENSE
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0008861_0009603.lab"
UM
THE
TRANSCRIPTION
BOX
HAS
GOT
A
SUMMARISE
BUT
BUTTON
WHICH
DOESN'T
DO
ANYTHING
YET
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0009603_0010391.lab"
UM
NOW
I
WONDER
WH
HOW
WE
WANNA
DO
YOU
KNOW
WE
WANT
A
POP
UP
WINDOW
WITH
THE
SPEAKER
CHARACTERISATION
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010620_0010958.lab"
UM
EITHER
WE
COULD
DO
THAT
YOU
KNOW
WHEN
DOES
THE
POP
UP
COME
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0010958_0011582.lab"
EITHER
WE
CAN
WHEN
YOU
CLICK
ON
THE
THE
I.
D.
ANY
SORT
OF
I.
D.
IN
THE
TRANSCRIPTION
BOX
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0011582_0012313.lab"
OR
WE
CAN
PUT
AN
EXTRA
BUTTON
EXTRA
FEW
BUTTONS
NEXT
TO
THE
SUMMARISE
BUTTON
SO
THAT
YOU
ACTUALLY
IN
THE
TRANSCRIPTION
BOX
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012313_0012838.lab"
BUT
SO
LIKE
YOU
CLICK
ON
A
BUTTON
AND
THEN
THAT
OPENS
WHATEVER
THAT
SPEAKER
CHARACTERISATION
IS
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0012838_0013481.lab"
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
R
THE
LEFT
CLICK
IS
ALREADY
USED
BECAUSE
IT
HIGHLIGHTS
THAT
UM
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0013662_0014263.lab"
THAT
PART
OF
SPEECH
OR
WHATEVER
THAT
WHAT
HE'S
BEEN
SAYING
YOU
KNOW
THE
THE
LEFT
CLICK
HIGHLIGHTS
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014263_0014755.lab"
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
YOU
DOUBLE
CLICK
ACTUALLY
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0014755_0015291.lab"
BUT
THAT'D
BE
A
BIT
ANNOYING
IF
YOU
HAVE
LEFT
CLICK
FOR
ONE
THING
AND
DOUBLE
CLICK
FOR
SOMETHING
ELSE
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015291_0015579.lab"
UM
I
THINK
SO
YEAH
WHEN
YOU
LEFT
CLICK
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0015579_0016074.lab"
YOU
CAN
FOR
EXAMPLE
SET
SET
THE
MARKER
THERE
SO
THAT
THE
MM
THE
AUDIO
GOES
FROM
THERE
I
THINK
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016268_0016434.lab"
UM
SO
WE
CAN'T
PUT
IT
ON
LEFT
CLICK
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016434_0016638.lab"
WE
COULD
PUT
IT
ON
A
RIGHT
CLICK
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0016638_0016875.lab"
WE

HAVE
A
LITTLE

THAT
POPS
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0017064_0017669.lab"

YOU
CAN
CLICK
ON
SPEAKER
CHARACTERISATION
UP
POPS
THE
WINDOW
.
"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018003_0018170.lab"
THAT'S
A
GOOD
POINT

"AMI_EN2002a_H02_FEO072_0018170_0018296.lab"
I
DON'T

"AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087384_0087866.lab"
AND
THEN
UM
SO
IF
WE
WANNA
DO
IT
THAT
WAY
YOU
KNOW
LIKE
IT
PROBABLY
DOESN'T
MATTER
TOO
MUCH
.
"AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0087866_0088246.lab"
JUST
TRYING

DEPENDING

FOR
WHAT
WE
WANNA
SEARCH
.
"AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0089859_0090212.lab"
THEN
IT'LL
UH
YOU

THERE'LL
BE
TWO
RESULT
PANES
.
"AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090212_0090467.lab"

DON'T
NOT
REALLY
TABS
.
"AMI_EN2002b_H03_MEE073_0090467_0090932.lab"

THEN
YOU

IT'S
JUST
LIKE

ARE
UM
SO

"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150779_0150892.lab"
ALRIGHT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0150892_0151721.lab"
BECAUSE
THAT
WOULD
BE
REALLY
HANDY
THEN
WE
CAN
ACTUALLY
TEST
IT
ON
THE
USER
AS
OPPOSED
TO
JUST
DOING
IT
AND
NOT
USING
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151721_0151946.lab"

THE
SEGMENTATION
THAT'S
GREAT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0151946_0152612.lab"

THAT
WOULD
WORK

"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0154929_0155000.lab"
THAT'D
BE
REALLY
NICE

"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159488_0159909.lab"

IT
UP
SPEED
THE
SEARCH
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0159909_0160355.lab"
BECAUSE
N.
X.
T.
OVER
THE
OVER
THE
WHOLE

THE
CORPUS
WAS
JUST
NOT
FEASIBLE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0160355_0160440.lab"
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0160737_0161085.lab"
NO
BUT

WOULD
JUST
BE
A
NICE
EXTRA
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0161826_0162209.lab"
YEAH
I
I
WASN'T
SURE
IF
IT
WAS
OR
NOT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162209_0162322.lab"
TRUE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162322_0162464.lab"
IT'S
TRUE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0162464_0162631.lab"
SO
WHAT
IT'S
ONLY
INTERIM
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163367_0163566.lab"
YEAH
I
MEAN
IF
YOU
HAVE
TIME

DO
THAT
AS

THAT'D
BE
REALLY
NICE
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0163798_0164155.lab"
\'CAUSE
I

THEN
THEN
IT
WOULD
GIVE
YOU
LIKE
IF
YOU
SEARCHED
FOR
A
WORD
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164155_0164659.lab"
IT
WOULD
GIVE
YOU
THE
THE
MEETINGS
BUT
ALSO
HOW
OFTEN
THE
W
THAT
WORD
OCCURRED
IN
THAT
MEETING
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164659_0164887.lab"
THAT
WOULD
BE
SO
USEFUL
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164887_0164944.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0164944_0164998.lab"

YEAH
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166254_0166691.lab"
YEAH
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
USEFUL
IF
YOU
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0166691_0167133.lab"
YOU
KNOW
YOU
C
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
IF
IF
YOU
SEARCH
FOR
LANGUAGE
AND
YOU
RETURN
LIKE
YOU
KNOW
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0167133_0167654.lab"
BASICALLY
ALL
OF
THE
MEETINGS
YOU
WANNA
SEE
WHERE
THEY
ACTUALLY
SPOKE
ABOUT
IT
AND
WHERE
THEY
JUST
MENTIONED
IT
ONCE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0168099_0168146.lab"
AH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0169068_0169150.lab"

HOW
WOULD
YOU
COMBINE
THEM
THAT'S
THE
QUESTION
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0184287_0185068.lab"
SO
TO
COME
BACK
TO
THE
START
UP
SCREEN
I'M
I'M
I'M
I'M
VERY
UNSURE
ABOUT
WHAT
THAT
SHOULD
LOOK
LIKE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0185068_0185739.lab"
I

THE
LONGER

LONGER
NAME

THE
USERS
THAT
TOOK
PART
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0186781_0187146.lab"
BUT
THEN
THAT'S
PROBABLY
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
FOR
THE
SAME
GROUP
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0187463_0187523.lab"
YEAH
I'M
NOT

"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0285410_0285498.lab"
IN
A
SENSIBLE
WAY

"AMI_EN2002c_H01_FEO072_0285850_0286022.lab"
WELL
WE'LL

"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002306_0002541.lab"
DOES
IT
SQUEEZE

AYE
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0002541_0002756.lab"
YEAH

"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0003721_0003846.lab"

"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0006431_0006531.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0006706_0006731.lab"
SURE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0009179_0009353.lab"
JUST
SAID
THE
SAME
THINGS
YOU
JUST
SAID
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0010398_0010516.lab"
SO
HOW
WE'RE
GETTING
ALONG
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017338_0017486.lab"
T
UH
I
WANTED
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THAT
ACTUALLY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0017486_0018262.lab"
UM
THIS
SPEAKER
UM
THE
DATA
PROCESSING
IS
FINE
BUT
UH
WE
DON'T
PARTICULARLY
WANT
TO
DO
THE
B
THE
THE
B
THE
GUI
FOR
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018262_0018397.lab"
NO
NOT
REALLY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0018397_0019186.lab"
IF
SOMEO
IF
YOU
WANNA
DO
THAT
THEN
THEN
TELL
ME
HOW
YOU
WANT
THE
DATA
PRESENTED
HOW
THE
\'CAUSE
DO
YOU
WANT
ME
TO
TELL
YOU
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019186_0019778.lab"
OKAY
LIKE
\'CAUSE
AT
THE
MOMENT
THE
THE
THE
THERE
IS
I'VE
CREATED
TWO
CLASSES
ONE
THAT
REPRESENTS
SPEAKERS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0019778_0020295.lab"
ONE
THAT
REPRESENTS
THE
MEETINGS
AND
THE
MEET
AND
THE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
BOTH
IS
CONTAINED
WITHIN
EACH
OBJECT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020295_0020877.lab"
SO
AND
THEN
THEY
WR
IT
WRITES
OBJECTS
AND
THE
OBJECTS
CONTAIN
ALL
THE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
MEETINGS
AND
THE
SPEAKERS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0020877_0021528.lab"
SO
THAT
THE
WHO
THE
SPEAKERS
THAT
ARE
AT
THE
MEETINGS
AND
THE
AMOUNT
THEY
SPEAK
AND
THEN
THE
AVERAGES
ARE
CONTAINED
WITH
THE
SPEAKERS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021528_0021812.lab"
SO
THERE'S
TWO
SEPARATE
CLASS
AREN'T
THERE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021812_0021965.lab"
AND
THEY
ALL
THEY'RE
TWO
DIFFERENT
OBJECTS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0021965_0022709.lab"
AND
YOU
CAN
RECALL
THEY
CAN
WRITE
THE
IT
WRITES
THE
OBJECTS
AND
THEN
YOU
CALL
THE
OBJECTS
BACK
AND
THEY
HA
THOSE
RETURNED
OBJECTS
HAVE
ALL
THE
INFORMATION
THAT
THEY
NEED
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0022709_0023131.lab"
AND
THEN
YOU
CAN
CALL
METHODS
TO
RETURN
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023131_0023532.lab"
OR
EVERYTHING
BUT
THAT'S
WHY
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
HOW
HO
WHAT'S
THE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
HAVE
THE
DATA
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0023891_0024199.lab"
YEAH
SUPPOSEDLY
ALL
CALCULATED
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024199_0024593.lab"
UM
AND
ALL
STORED
AS
OBJECTS
SO
DOT
OBJECT
FILES
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0024593_0025389.lab"
UM
WHICH
MEANS
THAT
YOU
JUST
RET
CALL
CONSTRUCTOR
AND
CALL
THE
LOAD
THING
AND
CALL
IT
THERE
AND
YOU
CAN
CREATE
A
LIST
OF
THEM
OR
A
VECTOR
OF
THEM
OR
WHATEVER
YOU
WANNA
DO
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025389_0025463.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025463_0025733.lab"
AND
THEN
OR
JUST
CALL
THEM
ONE
AT
A
TIME
TO
POPULATE
WINDOW
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0025733_0026149.lab"
BUT
THAT'S
WHAT
I
WANTED
TO
HOW
Y
HOW
WHAT
FORMAT
DO
YOU
WANT
THE
DATA
TO
COME
BACK
IN
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026149_0026783.lab"
\'CAUSE
IT
CAN
COME
BACK
AS
A
ALMOST
ANYTHING
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0026783_0026961.lab"
WHAT'S
EASIEST
TO
DISPLAY
ON
THE
SCREEN
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0027314_0027348.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028020_0028081.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028239_0028328.lab"
YEAH
CA
YOU
COULD
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0028672_0028802.lab"
YEAH

YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0029102_0030576.lab"
SO
UM
SO
I
CAN
HAVE
IT
SO
THAT
IT
RETURNS
YOU
A
\'CAUSE
AT
THE
MOMENT
THE
MAIN
DATA
STRUCTURES
ARE
HASH
TABLES
FOR
THE
MEETINGS
THAT
SAY
IT'S
GOT
ONE
THAT
SAYS
PERCENT
IT'S
CALLED
PERCENT
TALK
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030576_0030860.lab"
ONE'S
PERCENT
NOISE
AND
ONE
IS
PERCENT
PARTICIPATION
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030860_0030913.lab"
DO
YOU
SEE
WHAT
I
MEAN
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0030913_0031695.lab"
SO
AND
THEN
IT'S
GOT
INSIDE
IT'S
GOT
A
LINK
FOR
IT'S
GOT
A
IT'S
GOT
THE
N
SPEAKER'S
NAME
AND
THEN
IT'S
GOT
THEIR
PERCENTAGE
FOR
THAT
THING
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0031695_0032375.lab"
SO
IT
CAN
EITHER
COME
BACK
AS
A
YOU
CAN
HAVE
THE
HASH
TABLE
OR
YOU
CAN
HAVE
IT
RETURNED
AS
A
VECTOR
AND
IT
WILL
SAY
NOISE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032375_0032689.lab"
UH
JUST
A
STRING
IS
NOISE
W
X.
PERCENT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032689_0032977.lab"
IT
WILL
SAY
VECTOR
THIS
COU
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0032977_0033810.lab"
W
YOU
CAN
EITHER
HAVE
IT
TH
YOU
COULD
EITHER
HAVE
IT
YOU
COULD
I
HAVE
IT
LIKE
AN
EMBEDDED
IN
VECTOR
OR
ARRAY
OF
STRINGS
AND
EACH
ONE
REPRESENTS
ONE
PERSON
OR
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0033810_0034240.lab"
WHAT
THE
WHAT
THE
EASIEST
THING
DEC
HOW
HOW
YOU
WANNA
DISPLAY
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0034240_0034312.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0034640_0034795.lab"
YEAH
EXACTLY

"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0035962_0036317.lab"
SEE
THAT'S
THE
CA
HOW
DID
WE
CAN
I
HAVE
A
LOOK
AT
THAT
AGAIN
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036517_0036622.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0036622_0037082.lab"
S
IF
IT'S
IN
THAT
FORMAT
IT'S
SPEAKER
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037082_0037710.lab"
IT'S
SPEAKER
SPEAKER
IS
THE
UH
CONTROLLING
THING
NOT
YEAH
YEAH
OKAY
YEAH
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037710_0037768.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0037768_0038191.lab"
SO
ALL
OF
THIS
UH
ALL
THAT'S
CALCULATED
AS
WELL
STORED
AS
SPEAKER
OBJECTS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038191_0038361.lab"
YEAH
THAT'S
THAT'S
EASY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038361_0038476.lab"
SOME
ARE
QUITE
AMUSING
ACTUALLY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038476_0038941.lab"
THE
UH
THE
INFLUENCES
OF
I
LIVED
IN
GERMANY
FOR
SIX
MONTHS
DON'T
KNOW
IF
THAT
HAD
ANY
EFFECT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0038941_0039137.lab"
JUST
SPEND
TOO
MUCH
TIME
TALKING
TO
BRITS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039137_0039381.lab"
THAT
WAS
BIZARRE
THING
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039381_0039876.lab"
WHERE
DID
THESE
PEOPLE
COME
FROM
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0039876_0040167.lab"
SO
THEN
THE
ALL
THAT'S
CALCULATED
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0040167_0040336.lab"
ALL
I
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
GET
THE
DIALOGUE
ACTS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0040336_0040428.lab"
I
DON'T
THINK
THAT'LL
BE
DIFFICULT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0040641_0040692.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041434_0041734.lab"
SO
THEN
DOES
THIS
HOW
DOES
IS
HOW
IS
THIS
BOX
POPULATED
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0041734_0041973.lab"
IS
IT
POPULATED
BY
THE
ONE
PRESENT
OR
THE
ONE
HIGHLIGHTED
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042237_0042339.lab"
THE
ONE
PRESENT
OKAY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0042950_0043546.lab"
\'CAUSE
AT
THE
MOMENT
I'M
USING
THERE
IS
THERE
ARE
METHODS
THAT
SAY
UM
FOR
THE
USING
FOR
OTHER
TALKS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0043546_0044062.lab"
SO
THAT'S
AND
IT
SAYS
LIKE
GET
GET
TALK
TIME
AND
YOU
AND
Y
IT
TAKES
A
NAME
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044062_0044474.lab"
SO
THAT
W
COULD
CALL
THAT
WOULD
CALL
THAT
AND
CALL
THE
MEETINGS
METHOD
THAT
SAID
RETURN
THAT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044474_0044823.lab"
AND
THAT
WOULD
POPULATE
THAT
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
AN
EASY
THING
TO
DO
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0044823_0045043.lab"
UM
AND
THE
SAME
FOR
THAT
COMES
OUT
THERE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0046199_0046352.lab"
MEETINGS

YEAH
OKAY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047239_0047777.lab"
SO
I'LL
W
I'LL
JUST
LEAVE
IN
LOTS
OF
METHODS
THAT
ST
THAT'LL
JUST
RETURN
ONE
NUMBER
AT
A
TIME
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0047777_0048030.lab"
THAT'LL
BE
THE
EASIEST
WAY
TO

GET
TALK
TIME
I
THINK
IT'S
CALLED
AT
THE
MOMENT
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049571_0049713.lab"
NO
IT'S
STORED
AS
AN

"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0049713_0050140.lab"
IT
PROCESSES
A
WHOLE
LOT
OFF
LINE
AND
STORES
IT
AS
AN
OBJECT
AND
THEN
THEY'RE
MUCH
MUCH
SMALLER
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050140_0050561.lab"
THEY'RE
ONLY
LIKE

ONE
THOU
ONE

YEAH
IT'S
ALL
PRE
PROCESSED
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0050671_0050993.lab"
AND
THEN
IT'S
JUST

IT'S

WHAT
YOU
DO
IS
YOU
CALL

THE
TH
PROPER

WOULDN'T
BE
A

.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059029_0059346.lab"
AND
THEN
YOU
COULD
DO
A

THE

OVER
THE
OBJECTS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059346_0059579.lab"

THE

THESE
THESE
ARE
SO
SMALL
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0059579_0060210.lab"
THEY
CAN
LOAD
EACH
O
ALL
OF
THE

LOT
UP
AND
DO
A
SEARCH
OF
THE
WHOLE
LOT
TO
FIND
WHO
BY
WHO
AND
WHAT

OR
WHAT
TOPICS
WERE
IN
WHAT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0060210_0060321.lab"
SO
IT
DOESN'T
CRASH
THE
THING
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061027_0061353.lab"
WHAT
THE

COME
STRAIGHT
OFF
OF

DON'T
THEY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061353_0061562.lab"
\'CAUSE

THE

"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0061822_0062225.lab"
THE

KNOWS
ABOUT

.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0062858_0063016.lab"
NO
NO

I
DON'T
THINK
THAT'LL
BE
TOO
DIFFICULT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063289_0063528.lab"
WHAT
WE
WANT
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0063528_0063805.lab"
I
THOUGHT
THE
OTHER
STUFF
WAS
MORE
IMPORTANT
ANYWAY
SO
I
DID
THAT
FIRST
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064279_0064838.lab"
MM
NO
DESIGN
THE
GUI
FIRST
AND
UH
\'CAUSE
IT
IT
W
THE
PROBLEM
IS
IF
YOU
CHANGE
THE
CLASSES
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0064838_0065272.lab"
IT
THE
OBJECT'S
SERIAL
NUMBERS
CHANGE
AND
YOU
CAN'T
RE
LOAD
THE
OBJECT
SO
ALL
THE
PROCESSING
HAS
TO
BE
DONE
OVER
AGAIN
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065272_0065398.lab"
AND
I
HAVEN'T
QUITE
FINISHED
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065398_0065430.lab"
SO
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065605_0065949.lab"
IT
WOULD
BECOME
OUT
OF
SYNCH
AND
GET
A
BIT
FUNNY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0065949_0066289.lab"
IF
I
GAVE
YOU
ONE

ONE
AND
YOU
WORKED
ON
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066289_0066787.lab"
AND
THEN
I
CHANGED
IT
AND
RUN
THE
THING
AGAIN
YOU
WOULDN'T
EVER
BE
ABLE
TO
LOAD
THE
OBJECTS
BACK
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0066787_0067293.lab"
AND
YOU'D
HAVE
TO
AND
THEN
YOU'D
HAVE
A
V
MULTIPLE
COPIES
OF

ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
AND
IT'D
GET
SILLY
I
THINK
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0067637_0068265.lab"
BUT
IF
YOU
CAN
IF
YOU
WANNA

C
YOU
CAN
DO
THAT
WITHOUT

I'M
PRESUMING

"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069420_0069766.lab"

ALL
OF
THIS
STUFF
TOO
FIRST
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H02_MEE071_0069766_0069924.lab"

I
WAS

THAT
THEY

A

FIRST
BUT
NOT
NECESSARILY
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0104905_0105239.lab"
I
GUESS
IF
THEY'RE
DOING
A

THE
LOGIC
IN

YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107270_0107714.lab"
I
COULD
PROBABLY
EVEN
THAT
S
SHOULDN'T
BE
TOO
HARD
TO
PUT
A
CHECK
IN
THERE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0107714_0107884.lab"
AND
IF

WELL
THE
THINGS
THEY

JUST
BE
LOOKING

WHATE
YOU

IF
IT
SHOWS
UP
TEN
DIFFERENT
MEETINGS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114127_0114868.lab"
THEN
AT
THAT
POINT
THEY'LL
PROBABLY
WANNA
LIKE
WE
DO
WE
WANT
TO
LIKE
IF
IT
DUMPED
BY
DEFAULT
GOES
WITH
THE
FIRST
ONE
AND
THEY
WANT
NUMBER
FIVE
OF
THE
ONES
THAT
ARE
RETURNED
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0114868_0114978.lab"
I
MEAN
THEN
THEY
HAVE
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115184_0115431.lab"
WELL
NO
T
LIKE
TO
LOAD

LIKE
THE
THING
IS
THAT
I
THINK
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0115580_0116003.lab"
UH
LIKE
WHEN
IT
LOADS
UP
IT'LL
LOAD
UP
THE
TRANSCRIPT
WINDOW
AND
THE
WHATEVER
OTHER
WINDOW
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116003_0116206.lab"
RIGHT
NOW
I
THINK
JUST
THE
TOPIC
ONES
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116206_0116826.lab"
UM
ALTHOUGH
THE
TIME
IS
PROBABLY
MORE
UM
CAUSED
BY
LOADING
THE
ACTUAL
DATA
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0116826_0117456.lab"
SO
I'M
JUST
THINKING
IF
IT'S
KINDA
LIKE
YOU
WERE
SAYING
YOU
HAVE
TO
HAVE
A
NOM
OBJECT
RIGHT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0117456_0117835.lab"
I
MEAN
BEFORE
YOU
DO
A
SEARCH
AT
ALL
ON
THIS
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0117835_0117876.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0117876_0117953.lab"
OKAY
RIGHT
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0117953_0118007.lab"
THAT'S
TRUE
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118453_0118825.lab"
YEAH
BUT
THE
OKAY
THE
GLOBAL
ONE
FEEDS
INTO
THE
LOCAL
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0118825_0119318.lab"
UM
SO
IF
WE'RE
GETTING
ANY
USABLE
DATA
IT'S
IT'S
GONNA
BE
DOING
A
SEARCH
ON
EACH
OF
THOSE
FILES
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0119318_0119664.lab"
SO
IT'S
GONNA
BE
LOADING
UP
EACH
OF
THOSE
ONE
AT
A
TIME
TO
GET
THE
DATA
THAT
WE
WANNA
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0120428_0120470.lab"
RIGHT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0120470_0120896.lab"
BUT
IT'S
IT
COULD
BE
TIME
CONSUMING
LIKE
IF
THERE
ARE
TEN
DOCUMENTS
THAT
HIT
WITH
THIS
THING
THEN
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121059_0121075.lab"
OH
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121424_0121743.lab"
UM
YEAH
WELL
I'M
J
JUST
THINKING
OF
SOME
WAY
WE
COULD
YOU
KNOW

"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0121743_0122317.lab"
ST
CASH
THE
RESULTS
AND
IN
A
NICE
LITTLE
FORMAT
THAT'LL
MAKE
THINGS
A
BIT
EASIER
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0122317_0123043.lab"
BUT
THE
THING
IS
I
MEAN
IF
WE'VE
GOT
THAT
THEN
IT'S
GONNA
BE
NEEDING
REALLY
REALLY
TO
LOAD
THE
ENTIRE
CORPUS
FOR
THAT
MEETING
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123043_0123539.lab"
IF
UH
IF
IT'S
TRYING
TO
SHOW
US
WHERE
THOSE
WERE

IT'S
TRYING

HIGHLIGHT
THOSE
IN
THE
TEXT
TRANSCRIPT
OR
WHATEVER

"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123539_0123775.lab"

WE'RE
GONNA

ALL
THAT
OTHER
DATA
IN
THERE
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0123775_0124048.lab"
SO
EACH
TIME
WHEN
WE
HAVE
A

WE
HAVE
LIKE
YOU
KNOW
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124048_0124307.lab"
TEN
DIFFERENT

WITH
THE

WIRELESS
COMES
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0124307_0124688.lab"
GO

NEXT
ONE

"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0125272_0125338.lab"
OKAY
RIGHT
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0125539_0126076.lab"
IT
ALWAYS
SEEMS
TO
BE
SLOW
LOADING
UP
THE
FIRST
TIME
AT
LEAST
LIKE
THAT'S
ALL
I
I'VE
BEEN
DOING
LATELY
IS
JUST
SORT
OF
LOADING
IT
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126076_0126392.lab"
TEST
IT
TRY
SOMETHING

THEN
SHUT
DOWN
LOAD
IT
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002c_H03_MEE073_0126392_0126975.lab"
BUT
SO

BASED
ON

THEN
THAT
SHOULD
BE
F
ALRIGHT

I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
FRIDAY
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116565_0116699.lab"
YEAH
I
THINK
WE
BOTH
SHOULD
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0116932_0117417.lab"
WELL
THAT'S
THE
PROBLEM
BECAUSE
STEVE
HASN'T
GIVEN
US
ANY
DETAILS
HAS
HE
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118045_0118119.lab"
THAT'S
TRUE
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118486_0118681.lab"
I
I'M
SURE
WE
COULD
DO
THAT
IN
LIKE
A
MEETING
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0118798_0118957.lab"
AND
MAKE

YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119117_0119147.lab"

HAD
THE
THE
DEADLINE
LAST
FRIDAY
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0119597_0120310.lab"
BUT
WE
WON'T
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
ANY
EVALUATION
DURING
THE
WEEKEND
ANYWAY
SO
I
THINK
WE
COULD
SET
MONDAY
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0120589_0120727.lab"
AND
THAT
WOULD
GIVE
US
THE
WHOLE
WEEKEND

"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0124504_0124539.lab"
I
DON'T

"AMI_EN2002d_H01_FEO072_0124539_0124631.lab"
I
THINK
IT

WE
SHOULD
JUST

WELL
THEY'RE
YOUR

SO
YEAH
IT'S
NO
PROBLEM
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0027476_0027982.lab"
IT'S
JUST
MUCH
BIGGER

IT
UH

IN
THE

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0030007_0030205.lab"

THEY
DIDN'T

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0033821_0034404.lab"
I
PRODDED
IT

IT
DIDN'T
BREAK
TOO
M
I
DIDN'T
PLAY
THAT
LONG
BUT

IT
SEEMED
ALRIGHT

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0036363_0036835.lab"
THE
ONLY
THE

S
IT

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038566_0038773.lab"
I
THINK
IT'D

BETTER
ON
WINDOWS
AS
WELL
ACTUALLY
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0038773_0039024.lab"
\'CAUSE

THE
NATIVE

DOESN'T
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039024_0039068.lab"
SO
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039181_0039212.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0039343_0039428.lab"

SPEAKER
CHARACTERISATION
IS
FINISHED

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042029_0042437.lab"
I
HAVEN'T

IT
I
HAVEN'T

ALL
THOSE

\'CAUSE
IT
TAKES
AGES
ON
THESE
COMPUTERS
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042437_0042884.lab"
SO
I
DO
IT
IT'S
FASTER
FOR
SOME
BIZARRE
REASON
IF
I
LOG
IN
AT
HOME
AND
THEN
RUN
THE
CODE
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0042884_0043116.lab"
IT
RUNS

THAN
IF
I
DO
IT
HERE
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043116_0043133.lab"
BUT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043276_0043666.lab"
BUT
THAT'S
WHY
I
JUST
CAN'T
TO
SIT
IN
THE
LAB
AND
WAIT
HALF
AN
HOUR
OR
WHATEVER
IT
TAKES
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043829_0043889.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0043889_0044535.lab"
NO
I
TRIED
THAT
BUT
L
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044535_0044929.lab"
IT'LL
REALLY
SPEED

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0044972_0045397.lab"

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0045839_0045916.lab"
I

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0045916_0046646.lab"
I
SAW
THAT
IT
IT
DOE
IT'S
TELLS
TELLS
YOU
WHAT
SPEAKERS
UH
ARE
IN
WHICH

AND
THEN
YOU
CAN
SEE
WHICH
TOPICS
WHICH

YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0046646_0046715.lab"
SOMETHING

THEY'RE
QUITE
AMUSING
SOME
OF
THEM
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0047894_0048815.lab"
BUT
THERE'S
SOME
OF
THEM
SOME
OF

THE

ACTUALLY
WHAT
I
WANTED
TO

ABOUT

WAS
UM
THERE

THERE
ARE

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0048815_0049448.lab"
SO
THE
FIR
ONE
STATEMENT
IS
THAT
IT
WILL
B
I'D
REMOVED
IT
\'CAUSE
W
IT
WAS

EVERYTHING
IS
PREFIXED
BY

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0049448_0050088.lab"

SO
IT

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050245_0050314.lab"
SO
I
GOT
RID
OF
THAT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050314_0050682.lab"
AND
THEN
EVERYBODY
THE
NEXT
ONE
SEEMS
TO
MOSTLY
BE
BACK
CHANNEL
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050682_0050792.lab"
WELL
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHAT
THAT
MEANS
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0050792_0050952.lab"
WHO

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051210_0051277.lab"
IS
THAT

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051866_0051884.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051884_0051947.lab"
SOME
PEOPLE
DON'T
THOUGH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0051947_0052095.lab"
THERE
ARE
SOME
PEOPLE
WHO
DON'T
DO
THAT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052095_0052411.lab"
ACTUALLY
YEAH
YOU
CAN
SEE
THAT
THEY
DON'T
DO
THAT
AND
IT'S
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THEIR
LIST
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052411_0052523.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052523_0052876.lab"
I
KNOW
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0052876_0053288.lab"
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
AND
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
IS
A
BIG
ONE
THAT
COMES
UP
ALL
THE
TIME
YES
NO
QUESTIONS
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0053288_0053572.lab"
UM
UH
WHAT
ELSE
COMES
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054066_0054120.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054120_0054797.lab"
BUT
THAT'S
THE
THING
AND
SO
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
\'CAUSE
AT
THE
MOMENT
YOU
CAN
GET
THERE'S
A
METHOD
THAT
WILL
JUST
GIVE
YOU
THE
TOP
FIVE
FOR
OR
THE
TOP
X.
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0054797_0055107.lab"
YOU
GIVE
IT
ANY
NUMBER
AND
IT
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THE
TOP
WHATEVER
FOR
EACH
PERSON
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0055107_0056001.lab"
AND
THEN
EACH
MEETING
KNOWS
ABOUT
ALL
THE
DIFFERENT
DIALOGUE
ACTS
FOR
EACH
PERSON
IN
THE
MEETING
AND
THE
AMOUNT
THAT
THAT
OCCURRED
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056001_0056677.lab"
AND
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THAT
IN
TOP
ORDER
AS
WELL
OR
WILL
GIVE
YOU
OR
YOU
CAN
JUST
SEARCH
FOR
EACH
SPECIFIC
DIALOGUE
ACT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0056677_0057267.lab"
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
SEARCH
ON
IN
B.
S
AND
K.
S
RATHER
THAN
REAL
WORDS
RIGHT
AT
THE
MOMENT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057267_0057447.lab"
BUT
I
CAN
CHANGE
THAT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057447_0057616.lab"
UM
SO
I
DON'T
KNOW
WHAT
WE
WANT
TO
DISPLAY
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0057616_0057967.lab"
THAT'S
WHAT
I
M
THAT'S
WHAT
I'M
ASKING
YOU
REALLY
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0058705_0058934.lab"
ALL'S
A
LOT
ALL'S
LIKE
TWENTY
FIVE
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0059098_0059276.lab"
DIALOGUE
ACTS
PER

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061212_0061270.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061270_0061732.lab"
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
GLOBAL
TOP
FIVE
THAT
CAUSE
IT
EACH
SPEAKER'S
GOT
TOP
A
TOP
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0061732_0062279.lab"
AND
SO
JUST
SAY
ONE
OF
THE
BOXES
JUST
EXPLAINS
DOES
THIS
IS
MY
TOP
FIVE
DIALOGUE
ACTS
FOR
THE
SPEAKER
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0062279_0062926.lab"
AND
THEN
IN
THE
MEETING
YOU
HAVE
WHAT
YOU
COULD
EITHER
HAVE
THE
MOST
COMMONLY
OCCURRING
ONES
OR
YOU
COULD
HAVE
A
LIST
OF
EACH
SPEAKER'S
TOP
DIALOGUE
ACTS
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063063_0063146.lab"
EITHER
OF
THOSE
WOULD
DO
YOU
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063146_0063342.lab"
BUT
IT
WOULD
START
TAKE
A
LOT
OF
SPACE
IF
YOU
HAVE
IT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063541_0063654.lab"
OR
YOU
COULD
HAVE
NO
YOU
DON'T
NEED
THAT
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063654_0063991.lab"
SO
YOU
S
\'CAUSE
IT'S
\'CAUSE
IT'S
A
SPEAKER
WINDOW
THE
SPEAKER
CHARACTERISATION
WINDOW
COMES
UP
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0063991_0064404.lab"
SO
YOU'VE
GOT
THE
GLOBAL
ONE
THERE
AND
THEN
HERE
YOU
CAN
JUST
HAVE
THE
TOP
FIVE
IN
THIS
MEETING
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0064404_0064962.lab"

SOMETIMES
BUT
THEY'RE
NOT
THAT
COMMON
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067023_0067170.lab"
ONE
GUY
HAS
TOP
FIVE
JOKE
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067170_0067229.lab"
ONE

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067229_0067328.lab"
HE'S

YEAH
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0067426_0068442.lab"

THINGS
ARE
CODED
WITH
A
DIALOGUE
ACT

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073347_0073526.lab"
A
LOT
OF
THEM
ARE
CODED
WITH
Z.
WHICH
MEANS
NO
LABEL
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073526_0073733.lab"
SO
I
JUST
IGNORED
THAT
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073733_0073790.lab"
\'CAUSE
THAT'S
BORING

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0073946_0074059.lab"
AND
STATEMENT
WHICH
IS
BORING
.
"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074059_0074781.lab"
AND
ALSO
THE
OTHER
THING
THAT
THEY
HAVE
IS
UM
IF
SOMEBODY
QUOTES
SOMETHING
SO
IF
I
QUOTE
A
JOKE
TO
YOU
THEY
SEPARATE
THAT

"AMI_EN2002d_H02_MEE071_0074781_0075165.lab"
SO

DOUBLE
A
COLON
AND
THEY
PUT
THAT
ASIDE

ACTUALLY
MM
SOME
OF
MY
POINTS
MIGHT
OVERLAP
WITH
WHAT
WILLIAM'S
JUST
MENTION
BUT
BASICALLY
MY
METHOD
WAS
LIKE
UH
WHATEVER
BRAINSTORMING
WE
DID
IN
THE
LAST
MEETING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0062515_0063547.lab"
JUST
A
COUPLE
OF
VALUABLE
POINTS
AND
STARTED
DEVELOPING
ON
THAT
AND
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
MISSING
LOOPS
IN
THIS
THING
WHICH
I
THINK
WE'LL
UH
TAKE
A
FEEDBACK
FROM
THE
MARKETING
BECAUSE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0063691_0064255.lab"
UM
I
HAVEN'T
HAD
SOME

BASICALLY
EVERY

IS
MARKETABLE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064255_0064919.lab"
SO
PURPOSE
AS
WILLIAM
ALREADY
SAID
I
WOULD
PUT
IT
TO
SIMPLIFY
THE
INTERACTION
WITH
T.
V.
TO
MAKE
MAKE
IT
AS
SIMPLE
AS
POSSIBLE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0064919_0065298.lab"
AND
TO
SUMMARISE
I
I
WOULD
SAY
IT'S
IT
SHOULD
BE
USER
FRIENDLY
BY
BEING
EASY
TO
USE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0065404_0066192.lab"
RATHER
THAN
HAVING
A
LOT
OF
COMPLEX
BUTTON
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
HAVE
AN
ENGINEERING
MAYBE
HAVING
HUNDRED
BUTTONS
AND
MAYBE
HAVING
UH
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
WHICH
HAS
THE
MAIN
FEATURES
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066315_0066622.lab"
LIKE
VOLUME
CONTROL
OR
CHANNEL
CH
CHANGING
THE
CHANNEL
OR
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0066741_0067462.lab"
BUT
WE
ARE
TO
TO
MAKE
IT
UNIQUE
SO
THAT
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
BUY
IT
WILL
THIS
TWO
FEATURES
TOGETHER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0067462_0067737.lab"
SO
WHAT
THE
CONCEPT
IS
TO
HAVE
A
FLIP
TOP
MODEL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0067737_0069035.lab"
THE
MAIN
FUNCTIONS
SUCH
AS
WHICH
ARE
LIKE
OFTEN
USED
WILL
BE
ON
THE
TOP
AND
THE
COMPLEX
FUNCTIONS
WHICH
SAY
YOU
YOU
CAN
SAY
LIKE
THE
Y
YOUNG
GENERATION
OR
TRENDY
GENERATION
WANT
TO
PR
SAY
PROGRAMME
THEIR
FAVOURITE
CHANNELS
OR
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0069035_0069351.lab"
CAN
BE

PART
OF
THE
F
FLIP
TOP
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0069351_0070654.lab"
SO
IT'S
LIKE
IT
COULD
BE
ACCESSED
BY
A
WIDE
RA
RANGE
OF
UH
AUDIENCE
AND
WE
CAN
PUNCH
IN
NEW
F
FEATURES
SUCH
AS
UH
ADDED
FEATURES
SUCH
AS
SHOCK
PROOF
BODY
AND
MAYBE
A
DESIGN
TO
APPEAL
TO
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0070826_0072814.lab"
FINDINGS
MOST
PEOPLE
PREFER
US
USER
FRIENDLY
RATHER
THAN
COMPLEX
REMOTE
CONTROLS
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
TIMES
LIKE
UH
PEOPLE
HAVE
USED
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
FOR
SAY
A
YEAR
OR
SOMETHING
AND
THEY
THEY
ARE
NOT
USED
MAYBE
THIRTY
TO
FORTY
PERCENT
OF
THE
BUTTONS
SO
IT'S
NOT
OF
NO
USE
OF
PUNCHING
IN
THE
UH
TRYING
TO
PUT
IN
THOSE
THINGS
IN
ON
THE
TOP
OF
THE
REMOTE

AND
TRY
TO
CONFUSE
THE
USER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0072814_0073649.lab"
AS
WE
SAW
WE
WE
HAVE
TO
MAKE
A
PROFIT
ALSO
SO
WE
WE
CAN
MAYBE
GO
FOR
AN
ECONOMIES
OF
A
HIGHER
PRODUCTION
MM
BY
FIFTY
MILLION
WE
SAID
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H00_MEO015_0073649_0074378.lab"
YEAH
WITH
THAT
I
THINK
WE'LL
BE
ABLE
TO
ACHIEVE
ECONOMIES
OF
SCALE
ALSO
SO
WE
CAN
GIVE
IN
ADD

MAKE

ALL
THAT

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0112245_0112700.lab"

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0120646_0121783.lab"
SO
I
THINK
WHEN
WE
CAN
TAKE
A
CHEAPER
OPTION
WHICH
STILL
DOES
THE

KINDA
THING
UM
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SOMETHING
I
IT
NEEDS

BE
THE
THING
THAT
YOU
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0121865_0122367.lab"
USE

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122367_0122886.lab"
MAYBE
ON

YOU

SO
YOU
CAN'T

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0122886_0123385.lab"
YOU
GO

IT

YOU'RE
LIKE
OH

IT'S

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123385_0123711.lab"
SOMETHING
LIKE

BUT
THAT'S
THAT
SOUNDS
A
LOT
CHEAPER
TO
ME
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0123800_0124766.lab"
UM
THE
THIRD
THING
WAS
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
MAKE
SURE
THE

VERY
MUCH
INCORPORATED

.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0124766_0125253.lab"

WE

WE
WANT
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0125490_0125856.lab"
FASHIONABLE

GOOD
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0126492_0126781.lab"
UM
WE
NEED
TO
FOCUS

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0127388_0127446.lab"

WHAT
ABOUT
YOU
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE

UM
THE
CONTROLS
THAT
ARE
COMING

NOW
HAVE
KIND
OF
BIG
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0132750_0133469.lab"
RUBBER
BUTTONS
NOT
TINY
LITTLE
ONE
BIG
RUBBER
BUTTONS
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
I
MEAN
\'CAUSE
WE
GOT
TO
MAKE
IT
ORIGINAL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133620_0133736.lab"
WHAT
ABOUT

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0133869_0134201.lab"
UM
YOU
KNOW

YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0134432_0135394.lab"
UM
SO
YOU
IT'S
LIKE
A
LITTLE
PANEL
THAT
YOU
TOUCH
RATHER
THAN
A
BUTTON
WHICH
SHOULDN'T
WEAR
OUT
AS
MUCH
EITHER
NOT
SURE
ABOUT

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0135518_0135840.lab"
YOU
DON'T
HAVE

PUT
YOUR
THUMB
ONTO
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0135840_0137075.lab"
UM
THINK
THAT
MIGHT
APPEAL
I'M
THINKING
KIND
OF
JAPAN
I'M
THINKING
UH
YOUNG
UM
OFFICE
PEOPLE
TRENDY
KIND
OF
A
THING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0137206_0137531.lab"
UM
BUT
QUITE
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0137531_0138564.lab"
EASILY
LABELLED
SO
THAT
ANYONE
CAN
OH
YEAH
THAT'S
OBVIOUS
WHAT
THAT'S
FOR
AND
IT'S
NOT
DAUNTING
TO
MAYBE
THE
OLDER
GENERATIONS
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0140284_0140357.lab"
WERE
TOO
BIG

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0141076_0141112.lab"
MM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0145256_0146158.lab"
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
TO
DESIGN
ONE
PRODUCT
AND
THEN
THE
COMPANY
CAN
TAKE
IT
WHEREVER
THEY
WANT
TO
UH
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
THEY
CAN
MAKE
IT
SMALLER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146158_0146540.lab"
OR
THEY
CAN
MAKE
IT
BIGGER
OR
THEY
CAN
CHANGE
THE
FEATURES
SLIGHTLY
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0146796_0147715.lab"
IT'S
GONNA
BE
THE
SAME
SO
WE
NEED
TO
FOCUS
ON
JUST
ONE
THING
NOT
GET
BOGGED
DOWN
IN
LOTS
OF
DIFFERENT
UM
POSSIBILITIES
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0151286_0151974.lab"
OR
A
SPEECH
RECOGNITION
WHICH
IS
EXTREMELY
EXPENSIVE
I
THINK
THAT'S
THE
ONLY
WAY
THAT
YOU
KIND
OF
AVOID
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0152084_0152177.lab"
THAT
KIND
OF
ISSUE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0154752_0155002.lab"
WE
ARE
WE'RE
TALKING
ABOUT
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0155203_0155496.lab"
THE
TYPE
OF

THAT
WE'RE
WORKING
FOR
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0155496_0156520.lab"
THAT
THEY
WANT
UM
IT
TO
BE
FASHIONABLE
THEY
WANT
IT
TO
BE
TRENDY
AND
YOU
WOULDN'T
AUTOMATICALLY
ASSUME
ASSOCIATE
THAT
WITH
THE
OLDER
GENERATIONS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0156520_0157418.lab"
NOW
WITH
THE
BABY
BOOMERS
THE
OLDER
GENERATIONS
ARE
ACTUALLY
LARGER
THEY
HAVE
A
GREATER
POPULATION
THAN
US
YOUNG
PEOPLE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0157418_0157983.lab"
BUT
I
DON'T
THINK
WE'RE
FOCUSING

I
THINK
WE
ARE
FOCUSING
ON
A
SORT
OF
MID
RANGE
UM

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160471_0160942.lab"
OKAY
SO
THE

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0160942_0161612.lab"
UM
WE'VE
GOT

WE'VE
GOT
THE

NOW
THERE'S
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0161750_0162392.lab"
I
CAN'T
REMEMBER
WHAT
IT'S
CALLED

AT
THE
END
OF
PROGRAMME
DETAILS
YES
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0162580_0163755.lab"
WE
COULD
USE
THAT
AS
AN
ALTERNATIVE
TO

IN

THINGS
LIKE
THAT
IS
THAT
I
ALWAYS
FOUND
THAT
REALLY
EASY
WHEN
I
DISCOVERED
IT
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0163884_0164486.lab"
BECAUSE
YOU'VE
GOT
YOUR

ANYWAY
SO
IF
YOU
THERE'S
A
PROGRAMME
ON
YOU
WANT
TO
PUT
RECORD
ON
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164486_0164979.lab"
THAT'S
FINE

IF

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0164979_0165402.lab"
YOU

IT'S
NOT

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0165402_0165877.lab"
IT'S
NOT
A

IT'S
NOT

IT'S
NOT
ANYTHING
LIKE
THAT
IT'S
JUST
A

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166248_0166286.lab"
NO

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166423_0166641.lab"
YOU'VE

ANYWAY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0166940_0167575.lab"
IT
IS

IF
YOU
LOOK

ANY

THERE'S
A

IT'S

YOU

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0169712_0170288.lab"
NO
IT'S

I
THINK

MM-HMM

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0179443_0180041.lab"
THE

TAKING

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0181366_0181542.lab"
I

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0182307_0183125.lab"
THERE

THERE'S

MM

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0184469_0185430.lab"

WE
SHOULD
FOCUS
ON

A

ARE

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185430_0185816.lab"
IT

THEN
YOU
TRY

SEARCH
THROUGH
IT

"AMI_ES2004b_H01_FEE013_0185816_0186123.lab"

THE
UH
INDUSTRIAL

EXTRAORDINAIRE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0021996_0022501.lab"
\'KAY
THIS
IS
WHERE
I
WENT
A
BIT
MAD
WITH
POWERPOINT
SO
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022501_0022885.lab"
WHAT
THE
FIRST
THING
QUESTION
I
ASKED
WAS
WHAT
ARE
WE
TRYING
TO
DESIGN
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0022885_0023358.lab"
WELL
A
DEVICE
WHICH
BASICALLY
JUST
SENDS
THE
SIGNAL
TO
THE
T.
V.
TO
CHANGE
ITS
STATE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023358_0023844.lab"
WHETHER
THAT
BE
THE
POWER
OR
THE
CHANNEL
UM
OR
THE
VOLUME
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0023844_0024692.lab"
EVERYTHING
IS
JUST
UM
SOME
SORT
OF
SIGNAL
TO
CHANGE
THE
STATE
OF
THE
T.
V.
OR
OTHER
APPLIANCE
THAT
IT'S
SENDING
THE
SIGNAL
TO
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0024903_0025738.lab"
UM
SO
I
DECIDED
I'D
HAVE
A
LOOK
AT
WHAT
TH
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVE
DESIGNED
AND
TRY
AND
TAKE
SOME
INSPIRATION
FROM
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0025738_0026006.lab"
BUT
UH
ALTHOUGH
WE
WILL
WANT
TO
BE
TAKING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0026148_0027208.lab"
IDEAS
FROM
OTHER
PEOPLE
WE
WANNA
MAKE
SURE
THAT
OUR
DESIGN
STANDS
OUT
AND
I
THOUGHT
THAT
WAS
SOMETHING
THAT
WELL
IT
WASN'T
REALLY
MY
AREA
BECAUSE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027266_0027489.lab"
I'M
DEALING
WITH
THE
INSIDE
REALLY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0027489_0028055.lab"
SO
UM
YEAH
I
RAN
OUT
OF
TIME
SO
I
COULDN'T
DO
THIS
ONE
AS
FUN
AS
THE
LAST
ONE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0028055_0029482.lab"
UM
AND
UH
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
MOST
UH
CONTROLS
USE
SOME
FORM
OF
INFRARED
TO
SEND
SIGNALS
TO
THE
T.
V.
PRESUMABLY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
COST
ISSUE
OF
UH
SOMETHING
LIKE
UH
THE
SAME
THING
THAT
COMPUTERS
USE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029482_0029852.lab"
WIRELESS
AND
YOU
DON'T
NEED
TO
SEND
VERY
MUCH
INFORMATION
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0029852_0030249.lab"
UM
MOST
OF
THEM
ARE
POWERED
BY
SOME
FORM
OF
BATTERY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0030249_0030387.lab"
NOW
OUR
ONE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0030387_0032173.lab"
I'M
I'M
NOT
SURE
WHETHER
WE
WANT
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
SIZE
ISSUE
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
THEM
ARE
POWERED
BY
TRIPLE
A.
BATTERIES
BUT
THOSE
CAN
BE
QUITE
BULKY
SO
I
D
I
DIDN'T
KNOW
IF
YOU
WANTED
TO
LOOK
AT
SOMETHING
ELSE
UM
SO
WE
COULD
SHRINK
DOWN
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
CONTROL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032173_0032222.lab"
YEAH
SURE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032558_0032617.lab"
UM
NO
NO
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0032617_0033253.lab"
IF
YOU
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
MOST
REMOTE
CONTROLS
THEY'RE
QUITE
THEY'RE
QUITE
CHUNKY
AND
THAT'S
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
BATTERIES
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033253_0033769.lab"
THEY
HAVE
TO
BE
OBVIOUSLY
THIS
CERTAIN
SIZE
TO
FIT
THOSE
BATTERIES
IN
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0033769_0034754.lab"
YEAH
THE
THE
WELL
YOU
CAN
YOU
CAN
GET
THE
SORT
OF
CIRCULAR
ROUND
ONES
BUT
I'M
JUST
WONDERING
ABOUT
POWER
CONSUMPTION
AND
HOW
MUCH
YOU
NEED
TO
SEND
THE
DATA
ACROSS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0034754_0035461.lab"
UM
AND
D
WHICH
LEADS
SORT
OF
ONTO
THE
NEXT
POINT
ABOUT
\'EM
BEING
SMALL
AND
EASY
TO
CARRY
ROUND
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0035461_0036032.lab"
UM
NOW
THE
ONES
AT
THE
MOMENT
ARE
SMALL
BUT
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
IF
WE
COULD
LOOK
AT
SOMETHING
A
BIT
SMALLER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036119_0036880.lab"
NOW
THE
MAIN
COMPONENTS
I
CAME
UP
WITH
UM
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
THE
POWER
SOURCE
FOR
THE
BATTERIES
\'CAUSE
OTHERWISE
IT'S
NOT
GONNA
WORK
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0036880_0037334.lab"
UH
AS
I
SAID
ABOUT
THE
W
WHICH
BATTERIES
WE
WERE
GONNA
CHOOSE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0037334_0039212.lab"
WE
CAN
UH
DISCUSS
THAT
LATER
AND
THEN
YOU
OBVIOUSLY
NEED
SOMETHING
TO
DECODE
THE
INFORMATION
THAT
YOU'RE
PUTTING
IN
FROM
FROM
THE
CONTROLLER
AND
TO
TURN
IT
INTO
AN
I
UH
INFRARED
SIGNAL
WHICH
WE'RE
GOING
TO
USE
TO
SEND
THE
INFORMATION
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0039212_0040149.lab"
NOW
THESE
HAVE
A
WIRELESS
RANGE
OF
UP
TO
ABOUT
FIVE
METRES
WHICH
IS
SORT
OF
SUITABLE
FOR
ANYONE
WHO'S
WATCHING
THE
T.
V.
UNLESS
THEY'RE
IN
A
CINEMA
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0040149_0040724.lab"
WHICH
NOT
MOST
PEOPLE
DO
SO
AS
WE'RE
APPLYING
TO
THE
MOST
AUDIENCE
THAT
SHOULD
BE
FINE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0040724_0041786.lab"
AND
THEN
I
WAS
UH
JUST
HAD
A
QUICK
LOOK
AT
THE
EXTERNAL
DESIGN
BUT
I
D
I
LEFT
THAT
MOSTLY
TO
THE
UH
INTERFACE
DESIGNER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0041918_0042276.lab"
AND
SO
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
HAD
AS
THE
BASIC
IDEA
OF
WHAT
WE
WANNA
DO
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042276_0042828.lab"
IT'S
NOT
A
PROPER
CIRCUIT
I'M
NOT
SURE
IF
IT'D
WORK
OR
NOT
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0042828_0043307.lab"
I'M
NOT
EVEN
CONFIDENT
THAT
THOSE
ARE
THE
REAL
UM
THE
REAL
WAY
YOU'D
WIRE
IT
UP
BUT
ANYWAY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0043307_0044180.lab"
WE'VE
JUST
GOT
THE
THE
POWER
GOING
TO
THE
INFRARED
BULB
WITH
THE
CHIP
AND
THE
UH
U.
I.
INTERFACE
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044335_0044440.lab"
WHICH
WOULD
BASICALLY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0044440_0045351.lab"
WHEN
YOU
WHEN
YOU
PRESSED
ANYTHING
IT
WOULD
THE
CHIP
WOULD
CONVERT
IT
INTO
SOME
FORM
OF
I.
R.
DATA
WHICH
COULD
BE
DECODED
BY
THE
T.
V.
RECEIVER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0045351_0045881.lab"
WHICH
OBVIOUSLY
MEANS
THAT
WE'RE
GONNA
HAVE
TO
CONFORM
TO
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H02_MEE014_0045992_0047240.lab"
UM
WHATEVER
FORM
OF
COMMUNICATION
THAT
THE
T.
V.
S
ARE
ALREADY
USING
AND
SINCE
THAT
THAT'S
ANOTHER
USE
AND
REASON
TO
USE

THAT'S
WHAT
ALL

USE
AT
THE

UM
I'M
GOING
TO
LOOK
AT

FROM
THE

POINT
OF

AND
UH
OBVIOUSLY
OUR
STARTING

WITH

IS
ALWAYS
MARKET
RESEARCH
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0085725_0086149.lab"
UM
SO
THAT'S
WHERE
WE
STARTED
WE
USED
OUR
OUR
USABILITY
LAB
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086149_0086670.lab"
THE
COMPANY'S

LAB
WE
DID
OUR
USUAL
SELECTION
METHODS
TO
GET
A
CROSS
SECTION
OF
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0086670_0087219.lab"
MALE
AND
FEMALE
ALL
AGE
GROUPS
FROM
FIFTEEN
UPWARDS
AND
UM
WE
OBSERVED
THEM
IN
THE
LAB
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087219_0087626.lab"
JUST
THEIR
GENERAL
USE
OF
THE
REMOTE
CONTROL
YOU
CAN
SEE
WE
HAD
A
HUNDRED
SUBJECTS
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0087633_0088097.lab"
OUR
FINDINGS
LOTS
OF
FINDINGS
I'VE
JUST
SUMMARISED
SOME
OF
THEM
HERE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088097_0088814.lab"
THE
OVERALL
THING
WHICH
I'VE
I'VE
GOT
AT
THE
TOP
THERE
IN
ITALICS
IS
THAT
USERS
DISLIKE
THE
LOOK
AND
FEEL
OF
CURRENT
REMOTE
CONTROLS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0088814_0089076.lab"
SO
IT
HAS
OBVIOUS
DESIGN
IMPLICATIONS
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089076_0089559.lab"
UM
WE
FOUND
THAT
SEVENTY
FIVE
PERCENT
OF
USERS
FIND
MOST
REMOTE
CONTROLS
UGLY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0089695_0090332.lab"
EIGHTY
PERCENT
WOULD
SPEND
MORE
MONEY
WHEN
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
WOULD
LOOK
FANCY
WE
WERE
QUITE
SURPRISED
BY
THAT
FINDING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0090332_0091220.lab"
BUT
UM
THAT'S
QUITE
A
HIGH
PROPORTION
OF
OUR
OUR
YOU
KNOW
INTERNATIONAL
TARGET
GROUP
ARE
PREPARED
TO
SPEND
MORE
MONEY
FOR
SOMETHING
THAT'S
A
BIT
NICER
LOOKING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091220_0091790.lab"
UM
CURRENT
REMOTE
CONTROLS
DO
NOT
MATCH
WELL
WITH
THE
OPERATING
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
USER
OVERALL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0091790_0092588.lab"
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
CAN
SEE
BELOW
THERE
SEVENTY
FIVE
PERCENT
OF

ZAP
A
LOT
SO
YOU'VE
GOT
YOUR
PERSON
SUNK
BACK
IN
THE
SOFA
CHANNEL
HOPPING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092588_0092783.lab"
SO
AGAIN
THERE'S
POWER
IMPLICATIONS
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0092792_0093454.lab"
UM
FIFTY
PERCENT
OF
USERS
ONLY
USE
TEN
PERCENT
OF
THE

SO
AGAIN
A
BIG
DESIGN
ISSUE
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0093454_0094252.lab"
UM
AND
POSSIBLY
WE
CAN
ALSO
CUT
BACK
ON
COST
IF
WE
DON'T
HAVE
SO
MANY
FUNCTIONS
ACTUALLY
ON
THE
REMOTE
CONTROL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0094252_0094305.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0094690_0095591.lab"
THE
BIGGEST
FRUSTRATIONS
THAT
PEOPLE
FOUND
WITH
REGARD
TO
PERSONAL
PREFERENCES
WERE
UM
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
YOU
MENTIONED
EARLIER
UH
REMOTE
CONTROLS
ARE
OFTEN
LOST
IN
THE
ROOM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0095591_0096272.lab"
IT'S
A
SLIPPING
DOWN
THE
BACK
OF
THE
SOFA
TYPE
OF
THING
UH
FIFTY
PERCENT
WERE
WERE
PARTICULARLY
FRUSTRATED
BY
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0096272_0097238.lab"
UH
THIRTY
FOUR
PERCENT
OF
PEOPLE
TAKE
SAID
THEY
TAKE
TOO
MUCH
TIME
TO
LEARN
TO
USE
AND
I
THINK
THAT
TIES
IN
WITH
THE
UM
THE
PREVIOUS
FINDING
OF
PEOPLE
ONLY
USING
TEN
PERCENT
OF
THE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097238_0097521.lab"
THEY
JUST
CAN'T
BE
BOTHERED
TO
LEARN
ABOUT
THE
OTHER
FUNCTIONS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0097607_0098356.lab"
UM
UM
SLIGHTLY
MORE
THAN
A
QUARTER
OF
PEOPLE
SAID
IT
WAS
BAD
FOR
UH
REPETITIVE
STRAIN
INJURY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098356_0098896.lab"
YOU
KNOW
THOSE
SMALL
MOVEMENTS
OF
THE
REMOTE
CONTROL
CAN
LEAD
TO
KIND
OF
SHOULDER
AND
ELBOW
PROBLEMS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0098896_0099689.lab"
UM
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
THE
THIRTY
FIVE
AND
UNDER
AGE
GROUP
WOULD
LIKE
UM
A
LIQUID
CRYSTAL
DISPLAY
AND
SPEECH
RECOGNITION
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0099689_0100431.lab"
AGAIN
THAT
WAS
TO
AID
I
THINK
IN
UH
WHEN
THEY'VE
LOST
THE
ACTUAL
REMOTE
CONTROL
SOME
KIND
OF
SPEECH
RECOGNITION
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100431_0100548.lab"
SOMETHING
WE
DIDN'T
PUT
TO
THEM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0100548_0101364.lab"
BUT
WHICH
I'M
THINKING
OF
NOW
IS
UM
EVEN
IF
PERHAPS
THE
LOST
CONTROL
CAN
GIVE
OFF
A
BLEEP
EVERY
NOW
AND
AGAIN
TIL
YOU
FIND
IT
OR
A
FLASHING
LIGHT
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101364_0101496.lab"
POSSIBLY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101496_0101820.lab"
UM
THAT
TREND
REVERSES
IN
THE
OLDER
AGE
GROUPS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0101820_0102050.lab"
SO
THIRTY
FIVES
AND
UNDERS
WHO
WOULD
LIKE
THOSE
TWO
FEATURES
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102050_0102645.lab"
THAT
KIND
OF
EVENS
OUT
THIRTY
FIVE
TO
FORTY
FIVE
AND
IN
THE
OLDER
AGE
GROUP
IT
KIND
OF
REVERSES
THEY'RE
NOT
SO
BOTHERED
WITH
THIS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0102724_0103167.lab"
I
HAD
MARVELLOUS
TABLES
AND
THINGS
THAT
I
COULD
SHOW
YOU
BUT
I
THINK
I'LL
JUST
KEEP
IT
SIMPLE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0103167_0103614.lab"
IF
THERE'S
ANY
MORE
INFORMATION
I
CAN
EMAIL
YOU
EXTRA
DETAILS
IS
THAT
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0107683_0108058.lab"
MM-HMM
SO
CAN
WE
NOT
PROGRAMME
A
VIDEO
WITH
THIS
REMOTE
CONTROL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0108448_0108535.lab"
JUST
CHANNEL
HOPPING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0109768_0109931.lab"
WOULD
THAT
IMPLY
VIDEO
USE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0110866_0111006.lab"
MM-HMM
YES
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0112584_0112651.lab"
YES
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0113429_0114281.lab"
UM
WE
DIDN'T
REALLY
LOOK
INTO
THAT
BUT
REMEMBER
WE
FOUND
THAT
FINDING
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
ONLY
USE
ABOUT
UH
TEN
PERCENT
OF
THE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114281_0114818.lab"
I
THINK
TH
TH
THOSE
DO
TEND
TO
BE
THE
BASIC
CHANNEL
HOPPING
THINGS
AND
ON
AND
OFF
FOR
THE
VIDEO
FAST
FORWARDING
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0114818_0115453.lab"
SO
ON
AND
I
THINK
IT'S
SORT
OF
GENERAL
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
PEOPLE
DO
FIND
PROGRAMMING
THEIR
VIDEOS
A
NIGHTMARE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0115453_0115669.lab"
SO
I
DON'T
KNOW
IF
THAT'S
SOMETHING
WE
NEED
TO
LOOK
AT
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0115975_0116027.lab"
MM-HMM
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0116582_0117240.lab"
IN
FACT
I'VE
JUST
CALLED
UP
THAT
TABLE
THERE
WE
ASKED
THOSE
TWO
QUESTIONS
THE
TABLE
RELATES
TO
BOTH
QUESTIONS
SO
WE
DIDN'T
DIFFERENTIATE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117240_0117928.lab"
WOULD
YOU
PREFER
AN
L.
C.
D.
SCREEN
THAT'S
MULTI
FUNCTION
REMOTE
AND
WOULD
YOU
PAY
MORE
FOR
SPEECH
RECOGNITION
IN
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0117928_0118404.lab"
SO
YOU
CAN
SEE
HOW
THE
THE
YES
NO

OF
VARIES
ACROSS
THE
AGE
GROUP
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0118404_0118899.lab"
AND
A
SUBSTANTIAL
NUMBER
OF
DON'T

IN

OLDER

I
THINK
THAT'S
JUST
GENERAL
FEAR
OF

"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0119631_0119703.lab"

FURTHER

"AMI_ES2004b_H03_FEE016_0127142_0127782.lab"

QUESTION
IS
LIKE
SORRY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0076992_0077461.lab"
W
W
WHICH
ONE
WOULD
LAST
THE
LONGEST
BECAUSE
WE
DON'T
WANT
CUSTOMERS
TO
BE
LIKE
YOU
KNOW
CHARGING
LIKE
A
MOBILE
PHONE
EVERY
DAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0077596_0077934.lab"
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
LIKE
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
S
LOOK
AT
THE
LIFE
ALSO
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0080695_0080727.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0086528_0086575.lab"

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111124_0111763.lab"
SECOND
THING
IS
YEAH
AND
SECOND
QUESTION
IS
LIKE
A
MOBILE
YOU
CAN
CHANGE
THE
COVER
YOU
CALL
IT
A
SKIN
OR
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0111763_0112363.lab"
SO
IN
THIS
CASE
IF
YOU'RE
LOOKING
AT

A
CUSTOMER
CAN
CHANGE
THE
COLOUR
LIKE
FROM
GREEN
PARROT
GREEN
TO
CHILLI
RED
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0112363_0112923.lab"
SO
IS
THAT
FEATURE

LIKE
UH
TITANIUM
OR
IT'S
LIKE
ONLY

SOMETHING

ALRIGHT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0117973_0118068.lab"
THAT
COULD
BE
A
GOOD
IDEA
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0118192_0118395.lab"
IT
COULD
IT
WOULD
BE

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0125060_0125310.lab"
SORRY

F
FOR

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0135328_0136485.lab"
IF
HE
WOULD
A
PERSON
WHO
SWITCHES
CHANNELS
VERY
OFTEN
OR
DOES
USE
A
PARTICULAR
FUNCTION
VERY
OFTEN
WILL
FIND
IT
VERY
IRRITATING
TO
USE
A
AND
HE
MIGHT
SPOIL
THE
TOUCH

VERY
FAST
COMPARED
TO
A
BUTTON
LIKE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0136485_0136741.lab"
IF
YOU
KEEP

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138042_0138503.lab"
AND
JUST
ONE
SMALL
QUESTION
BEFORE

YOU
ARE
REGARDING
THE
CIRCUIT
SINCE
WE
ARE
HAV
HAVING
A
FLIP
TOP
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0138503_0139147.lab"
WE
CAN
CUSTOMISE
THE
TWO
CIRCUITS
FOR
DIFFERENT
TYPE
OF
BUTTONS
LIKE
WE
ARE
KEEPING
THE
STANDARD

ON
THE

THE
MORE
COMPLEX
BUTTONS
UNDER
THIS
THING
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0139147_0139304.lab"
SO
WE
CAN
DIVIDE
THE
CIRCUIT
LIKE
YOU

.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0139598_0139618.lab"

SOMETHING

I
DID
HERE

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149237_0149677.lab"
FIRST
THING
IS
UH
BASICALLY
ON
DESIGN
WE
JUST
TOOK
THE
INPUT
FROM
THE
PREVIOUS
MEETING
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0149677_0150290.lab"
ESPECIALLY
FROM

THE

NEEDS
AND
FEASIBILITY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150290_0150802.lab"
SECOND
IS
WE
CHECKED

THE

OFFERED
BY

HERE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0150802_0151570.lab"
SO
Y
YOU
GENERALLY
SEE
THERE'S
NOT
MUCH
OF
VARIETY
AND
LIKE
MARKETING
TEAM
SAID
UH
PEOPLE
NEED
TRENDY
THEY
ARE
BORED
OF
BLACK
AND
WHITE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0151570_0152116.lab"

MONOTONOUS
KIND
OF
DESIGNS
HERE

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152292_0152729.lab"
AND
UH
SECOND
THING
IS
THERE'S
TOO
MUCH
OF
CONFUSION
HERE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0152729_0152905.lab"
NO

.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154292_0154798.lab"
REST
OTHER

THEY

AND
THEY

WITH

ALL
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0154928_0155214.lab"

AND
SECOND
AS
ALREADY
DISCUSSED
WITH

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0155214_0156212.lab"
WE

THAT
MEANS
THE
USE
OF

IS
FREQUENT
SURFER

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0159878_0160312.lab"

INCONSISTENT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0166613_0166912.lab"
OKAY
WE
HAD
A

THERE
WAS
A

.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167049_0167557.lab"

MENTIONS
THAT
OUR

RECOGNITION
S
FEATURE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0167557_0168273.lab"
WE
HAVE
TO
CHECK
INTO
THE

FINANCIAL
F
FEASIBILITY
WHETHER
WE
CAN
INCORPORATE
IT
THIS
AT
A
LOW
COST
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0168273_0169125.lab"

FOR
LIKE
WE

UM

HAVE
THE
FEATURE
OF
FINDING
IT

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169125_0169527.lab"
SO
IT
COULD
BE

WHERE
IS
THE
REMOTE
AND
THE
REMOTE
ANSWERS
I
AM
HERE

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0169527_0170446.lab"
SOME
KIND
OF

OR
IT
GIVES
A
B
BLEEP
SOUND
OR
SOME
KIND
OF

AND
IF
THIS
CAN
BE
INCORPORATED
THIS
WOULD
BE
MORE
UH
YOU
CAN
SAY
TRENDY
ALSO
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170446_0170664.lab"
AND
TECHNOLOGICALLY
INNOVATIVE
ALSO
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0170898_0171243.lab"
SO
WE
WE
CAN
CHECK
INTO
THE
FINANCIAL
FEASIBILITY
OF
INCORPORATING
THIS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0171623_0172153.lab"
MY
PERSONAL
PREFERENCES

BE
LIKE
AS
ALREADY
UH
MARKETING
DEPARTMENT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172153_0172555.lab"
THEY
WANT
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
FRUIT
SO
I
WOULDN'T
SAY
THE
DESIGN
SHOULD
BE
LIKE
A
FRUIT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0172555_0173179.lab"
BUT
YEAH
WE
CAN
TAKE
INSPIRATION
FROM
FRUIT
COLOURS
LIKE
THE
VIBRANT

RED
CHILLI
UH
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0173301_0174236.lab"
TOMATO
RED
OR
WHATEVER

SECOND
THING
IS
CER
CERTAIN

SHOULD
HAVE

I
IF
YOU
SEE
THE

SLIDE
UH
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0174609_0175151.lab"
I
THINK
MOST
OF

NOW
BE
WELL
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THIS
CER
CENTRAL
PATTERN
HERE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0175151_0175720.lab"
SO
WE
WE
WE
WOULD
NOT

THAT

BECAUSE
I
THIS
IS
THE

CONSISTENT

IN

"AMI_ES2004c_H00_MEO015_0176016_0176429.lab"

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0008544_0009352.lab"
RIGHT

WE'RE
SLIGHTLY
AHEAD

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0009477_0009969.lab"

WATCHING

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011269_0011501.lab"

I

WE'VE
TOUCHED

A
FEW
THINGS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0011664_0011891.lab"
TO
DO

WE
COULDN'T
USE

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0013372_0014280.lab"
IT
WASN'T
GONNA
BE
A

FOR

UM
AND
THAT
WE
HAD
TO
INCORPORATE
THE

A

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016044_0016539.lab"
WE
WERE
THINKING
A

SOMETHING
ALONG
THOSE

JUST
A
DIFFERENT

FROM
WHAT'S
NORMAL
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0016897_0017210.lab"
YOU

LOOK
INTO
THE
RECHARGEABLE
BATTERIES

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017331_0017939.lab"

WE

THINGS
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0017939_0018862.lab"

OUR

UM
YES
THANK

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0038856_0038972.lab"
I
HATE
THOSE

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0039096_0039596.lab"
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
DO
THEM
ON

TIGHT
AND
YOU
CAN'T
GET

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0041079_0041124.lab"

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0050799_0051223.lab"
I

CAN
YOU
PICK
IT
UP
AND
THEN
WIND
IT
FOR
TWO
MINUTES
AND
THEN
THAT'S
IT
FOR
THE
NIGHT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0051223_0051297.lab"

THAT
DOESN'T

YOU
DON'T
WANT

THERE
ARE

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058059_0058272.lab"

IT

BE
CHARGING
THROUGH
THE
DAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0058272_0058872.lab"
I
THINK

YOU'VE

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0059012_0059060.lab"

YOU
PUT
IT
ON

THEN
YOU

I
THINK
THE
ONLY
PITFALL
THAT
WE

BE
HOW
MUCH
IT'S
GOING

THAT

WE
HAVE

SOMEWHERE
ELSE

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0185833_0186520.lab"
BUT
I
THINK
PRETTY
MUCH
WE'VE
USED
CHEAP
RELATIVELY
CHEAP
AND
SIMPLE
THINGS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0186520_0186655.lab"
THE

WE'VE
GOT

ISN'T
IT

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0192189_0192592.lab"

THERE'S

I
THINK
SO

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0200704_0201858.lab"
NO
I
THINK
I
WE
DON'T
WANNA
BE
TACKY
IF
WE'VE
GOT
A
KIND
OF
DIFFERENT
SHAPE
ANYWAY
UM
THE
FACT
THE
M
THE
MATERIAL
THAT
WE
WOULD
BE
USING
WOULD
BE
CHEAP
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0201858_0202008.lab"
SO
WE
COULD
MAKE
IT
RED
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202008_0202770.lab"
WE
COULD
MAKE
IT
UM
PSYCHEDELIC
YOU
KNOW
WE
COULD
MAKE
IT
BLACK
AND
WHITE
ZEBRA
STRIPES
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0202770_0203384.lab"
BUT
THAT'S
NOT
REALLY
WHAT
WE'RE
FOCUSING
ON
WHAT
WE'RE
FOCUSING
ON
IS
THE
M
YOU
KNOW
YES
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0203384_0203662.lab"
SO
WE
COULD
JUST
PICK
ANYTHING
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0205521_0206423.lab"
IT'S
JUST
DIFFERENT
IT'S
JUST
DIFFERENT
FROM
EVERYTHING
ELSE
AND
I
MEAN
I'M
TRYING

IMAGINE

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0206423_0207105.lab"
SORT
OF

BLACK
UM
SO
YOU
EITHER
WANT
SOMETHING
THAT
GOES
WITH
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0207105_0207294.lab"
WHICH
IS
WHAT'S
ON
THE
MARKET
ANYWAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0207294_0208360.lab"
OR
YOU
WANT
SOMETHING
THAT
CONTRASTS
AS
YOU
KNOW
LIKE
YOU
GET
CLOCKS
NOW
THAT
ARE
MORE
OF
A
TALKING
POINT
THAN
AN
ACTUAL
CLOCK
BECAUSE
THEY'RE
SO
INTERESTING
AND
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0209017_0209065.lab"
MM
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0209428_0210011.lab"
AND
YOU
WOULD
JUST
HAVE
AN
ACROSS

YOU
WOULD
HAVE
SO
MANY
DIFFERENT
OPTIONS
THAT
YOU
COULD
DO
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0210011_0210708.lab"
YOU
COULD
HAVE
UM
A
PLAIN
BLACK
ONE
YOU
COULD
HAVE
SPARKLY
PINK
GLITTERY
ONES
FOR

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0211386_0211436.lab"
MM
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0211630_0212456.lab"
AND
ONES
THA
ONES
THAT
HAVE
RUBBERY
SPIKES
Y
YOU
KNOW
YOU
COULD
JUST
GO
SO
FAR
WITH
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0212456_0213177.lab"
LIKE
A
PUFFER
FISH
YOU
COULD
JUST
YOU
COULD
TAKE
IT
WHEREVER
SO
I
THINK
THAT'S
QUITE
A
FLEXIBLE
THING
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0213669_0213719.lab"
YES

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0214962_0214989.lab"
YEAH

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0215226_0215710.lab"
OKAY
WE'VE
GOT
FIVE
MINUTES
UM
OR
THAT
MIGHT'VE
BEEN
UP
FOR
A
WHILE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0218378_0218419.lab"
MM-HMM
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0222133_0222216.lab"
HAVE
YOU

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0222658_0222715.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0223557_0224476.lab"
WELL
THEY
DO
BUT
I
THINK
WE
CAN
YOU
COULD
WELL
IT
IS
IT
IS
I
THINK
YOU
JUST
ADDRESS
THAT
WITH
UM
ADVERTISING
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0224476_0225035.lab"
UM
YOU
ASSOCIATE
THE
NAME
WITH
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PRODUCT
THAT
IT
IS
AND
THAT
DOES
THE
WORK
FOR
YOU
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225035_0225419.lab"
OBVIOUSLY
IT'LL
HAVE
A
LOGO
ON
IT
JUST
LIKE
EVERYTHING
BUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
HAS
A
LOGO
ON
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0225419_0226057.lab"
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
IT'S
GOT
TO
STAND
OUT
SOMEHOW
DIFFERENTLY
BUT
I
THINK
IT
DOES
WITHOUT
THAT
SO
I'M
NOT
WORRIED
ABOUT
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0226877_0227640.lab"
DEPENDING
ON
HOW
I
I
MEAN
WE'VE
GOT
THIS
MEMO
SAYING
THAT
IT'S
SOMETHING
THAT
THE
COMPANY'S
LOOKING
INTO
SO
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0227763_0228698.lab"
UM
THAT
SEEMS
TO
MAKE
SENSE
BUT
IF
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
IT'S
HUGELY
EXPENSIVE
WE'D
HAVE
TO
CUT
DOWN
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
THEN
IT'S
WORTH
THINKING
ABOUT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0228698_0229151.lab"
BUT
I
THINK
WE'LL
FIND
OUT
MORE
ABOUT
COST
AFTERWARDS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229151_0229325.lab"
RIGHT
I'M
GOING
TO
WRAP
IT
UP
THERE

"AMI_ES2004c_H01_FEE013_0229632_0230258.lab"

THERE

YOU

YOU

I
DON'T
I
DON'T
THINK
IT'S
REALLY
SORT
OF
NECESSARY
WHEN
YOU
TH
YOU
THINK
OF
THE
NEXT
TWO
OPTIONS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0052412_0053316.lab"
LIKE
THE
THE
SOLAR
CHARGING
\'CAUSE
MOST
PEOPLE
HAVE
THE
LIGHT
ON
IN
THE

ANYWAY
SO
THEY
COULD
GET
WHEN
WHEN
YOU
GOT
T.

.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053519_0053553.lab"
NO

"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053691_0053742.lab"

"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0053742_0053910.lab"
ALRIGHT
I
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055103_0055725.lab"
YEAH
IT
WOULD
THE
D
YEAH
THE
DYNAMO
WOULD
TAKE
MORE
SPACE
\'CAUSE
YOU
ACTUALLY
NEED
A
PHYSICAL
SORT
OF
HANDLE
TO
WIND
UP
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0055977_0056085.lab"
YEAH
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0057173_0057204.lab"
BUT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0057514_0058039.lab"
YEAH
AND
MOST
PEOPLE
MOST
PEOPLE
ALSO
WATCH
T.

IN
THE
IN
THE
NIGHT
ANYWAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0058725_0059062.lab"
BUT
I
I
THINK
I
THINK
THE
THE
NEXT
ONE'S
THE
BEST
ANYWAY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059062_0059834.lab"
THE
THE
KINETIC
CHARGING
WHICH
IS
LIKE
YOU
GET
IT
IN
R
YOU
GET
IT
IN
WRIST
WATCHES
AND
YOU
D
YOU
DON'T
EVEN
NOTICE
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0059834_0060386.lab"
I
MEAN
THE
AMOUNT
THE
AMOUNT
OF
PROBABLY
MOVING
AROUND
YOU'D
BE
DOING
ALL
THE
TIME
WOULD
WOULD
CHARGE
IT
UP
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0060386_0060805.lab"
I
DON'T
THINK
YOU'D
EVER
NEED
TO
ACTUALLY
PHYSICALLY
START
SHAKING
IT
UP
TO
MAKE
IT
WORK
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0061351_0062662.lab"
UM
YEAH
IT'S
IT
CHARGES
INTO
UM
SOME
FORM
OF
IT'S
A
SMALLER
CELL
WHICH
IT
CHARGES
INTO
AND
UH
THE
SI
THE
SIZE
SORT
OF
A
WATCH
A
WATCH
BATTERY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062662_0062874.lab"
\'CAUSE
THEY
USE
THEM
QUITE
FREQUENTLY
IN
WATCHES
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0062874_0064041.lab"
AND
THAT'LL
THAT
WOULD
L
WOULD
LAST
FOR
UM
WELL
I
DO
I
D
I'M
NOT
ENTIRELY
SURE
HOW
LONG
IT
WOULD
LAST
BUT
I'VE
NEVER
SEEN
ONE
RUN
OUT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0064511_0064551.lab"

AND
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0065538_0066039.lab"
YEAH
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
I
I
THINK
IT
IS
BECAUSE
IF
YOU
THINK
ABOUT
IT
THE
WATCH
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0066039_0067333.lab"
ALTHOUGH
IT'S
ONLY
A
TINY
AMOUNT
IT'S
IT'S
UM
IT'S
ALWAYS
MOVING
FOR
THE

THEY
DON'T
RUN
OUT
OVER

YOU
LEAVE
THEM
ON
THE
SIDE

"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0067333_0067624.lab"
AND
TH
FOR
THE
SAME
THE
SAME
REASON
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0067624_0068678.lab"
YOU'RE
ONLY
USING
IT
FOR
A
V
INCREDIBLY
SHORT
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
JUST
TO
SEND
THE
SIGNAL
AND
THEN
YOU'RE
FINISHED
WITH
IT
AND
YOU
PUT
IT
NO
NO
I
DO
I
DON'T
THINK
THE
THE
DRAW
ON
IT
WOULD
BE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0068853_0068905.lab"
MM
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0069582_0070774.lab"
YE
YEAH
I
THINK
I
TH
UH
G
Y
YOU
COULD
HAVE
A
DUAL
UM
POWER
THING
BUT
THE
THE
THING
WITH
THE
SOLAR
CELLS
IS
YOU
WOULD
NEED
TO
PUT
THEM
ON
THE
CASE
AND
THEY
BECAUSE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0070774_0071499.lab"
IF
YOU
LIE
ON
A
CALCULATOR
THEY
THEY'RE
QUI
THEY'RE
QUITE
BIG
AND
THEY
ALL
THEY
ALL
LOOK
I
IDENTICAL
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0071725_0071915.lab"
THEY'RE
THEY'RE
EXPENSIVE
THEY
DON'T
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0072299_0073132.lab"
YEAH
THE
NORMAL
BATTERIES
WOULD
BE
THE
CHEAPEST
I'D
PRESUME
THEN
IT
WOULD
ACTUALLY
BE
THE
THE
SOLAR
CHARGING
ONES
UM
BUT
THE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0073243_0073799.lab"
IT'S
I
I
THINK
THEY'RE
NOT
VERY
RESISTANT
TO
DROPPING
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0073799_0074827.lab"
\'CAUSE
IF
YOU
DROP
STUFF
YEAH
IF
YOU
IF
YOU
HAVE
Y
THE
SIZE
YOU'D
NEED
TO
CHARGE
A

WOULDN'T
BE
THAT
BIG
BUT
I
MEAN
IF
REMOTES
ALWAYS
GET
THROWN
AROUND
AND
STUFF
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0074827_0074850.lab"
SO
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0074990_0075189.lab"
Y
I
THINK
YEAH
PRACTICALLY
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0075365_0076057.lab"
I
MEAN
CALCULATORS
YOU
DON'T
REALLY

A

YOU
DO
THEY
CAN
T
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0076239_0076697.lab"
YEAH
THEY
DO
THEY
YEAH
THEY'VE
GOT
DUAL
THINGS
BUT
THEY'RE
THE
BATTERIES
ARE
SMALLER
I
THINK

I
DON'T

YOU

OKAY
WELL
I'LL
MOVE
ON
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0087485_0088899.lab"
UM
MY
SECOND
PART
OF
MY
FINDINGS
UH
THE
MO
MOST
CURRENT
REMOTES
USE
THIS
SILICONE
UH
P.
C.
B.
BOARD
WHICH
PR
PRINTED
CIRCUIT
BOARD
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0088899_0089550.lab"
WHICH
BASICALLY
HAS
THESE
CONTACTS
THAT
ARE
REALLY
CLOSE
TOGETHER
AND
THEN
WHEN
YOU
PRESS
DOWN
ON
THE
RUBBER
BUTTON
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0089550_0091768.lab"
IT'LL
CONNECT
THE
CIRCUIT
AND
EACH
EACH
SWITCH
IS
CONNECTED
TO
TWO
UH
DIFFERENT
LEGS
ON
THE
CHIP
AND
SO
SENDS
A
DIFFERENT
MESSAGE
AND
THAT
THEN
UH
GETS
TRANSLATED
BY
THE
CHIP
INTO
A
CODE
AND
THEN
IT'S
FIRED
OUT
OF
THIS
L.
E.
D.
IN
THE
SEQUENCE
OF
L
ON
AND
OFF
BURSTS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0092527_0092560.lab"
WELL
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0092714_0093013.lab"
WELL
THIS
THE
THI
THE
THING
ABOUT
IS
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0093157_0094354.lab"
THEY
THEY
CAN
BE
AS
BIG
OR
AS
SMALL
AS
YOU
WANT
THEM
TO
BE
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
YOU
CAN
PRINT
CIRCUIT
BOARD
LIKE
THAT
THAT
IT'S
IT'S
SIMPLY
SPACED
LIKE
THAT
SO
YOU
CAN
HAVE
FIT
THE
N
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
NINE
BUTTONS
IN
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094354_0094603.lab"
IF
YOU
IF
YOU
SEE
HOW
THIN
THE
TRACKS
ARE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0094603_0095211.lab"
YOU
COULD
YOU
COULD
S
YOU
COULD
PUT
THEM
VIRTUALLY
RIGHT
NEXT
TO
EACH
OTHER
AND
HAVE
A
MUCH
SMALLER
SWITCH
ON
EACH
ONE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0095211_0096216.lab"
IF
YOU
IF
YOU
WANTED
TO
BUT
UM
THE
THERE
IS
AN
OPTION
TO
DO
TO
DO
IT
LIKE
THAT
OR
YOU
COULD
HAVE
SOME
SORT
OF
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096359_0096753.lab"
ARRAY
OF
SWITCHES
WHICH
I'LL
SPEAK
ABOUT
IN
THE
NEXT
BIT
SO
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0096908_0097666.lab"
AND
THEN
TO
UH
YEAH
SO
TO
CONSERVE
BATTERY
LIFE
THE
REMOTE
SHOULD
BE
IN
A
STANDBY
MODE
NO
WHILE
NOT
BEING
USED
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0097666_0098463.lab"
NOW
WHAT
I
WAS
THINKING
ABOUT
THAT
WAS
\'CAUSE
SOMETIMES
WHEN
Y
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
THESE
THINGS
THEY'VE
GOT
LITTLE
LIGHTS
ON
BEHIND
THE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0098463_0099218.lab"
SO
YOU
CAN
SEE
WHAT
ALL
THE
BUTTONS
ARE
LIKE
ON
A
MOBILE
PHONE
THEY
DO
IT
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
ON
A
THAN
ON
A
T.
V.
REMOTE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099218_0099999.lab"
BUT
YOU
COULD
YOU
COULD
HAVE
LIGHTS
BEHIND
THE
BUTTONS
AND
UM
AFTER
LIKE
FIVE
OR
TEN
SECONDS
OF
NOT
BEING
USED
I'D
HAVE
THAT
TURNED
OFF
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0099999_0100304.lab"
IF
WE
DECIDED
TO
GO
FOR
BUTTONS
THAT
COULD
LIGHT
UP
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0100491_0101417.lab"
UM
THE
CASE
MATERIAL
I'VE
A
BEEN
SENT
WHAT
THE
FACTORY
CAN
ACTUALLY
GIVE
US
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0101417_0102327.lab"
THE
THERE'S
THE
PLASTIC
WHICH
I
THINK
WE
WERE
GONNA
GO
FOR
ANYWAY
AS
THE
MAIN
CASE
CASE
HOUSING
AND
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0102459_0103250.lab"
THE
THE
MAIN
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
WELL
YOU
COULD
GO
FOR
WOOD
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
A
BIT
IMPRACTICAL
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0103250_0104324.lab"
TITANIUM
UM
VERY
EXPENSIVE
JUST
TO
PROCESS
WHICH
TO
MAKE
IT
IS
EXPENSIVE
AND
RUBBER
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0104324_0105188.lab"
WELL
YOU'RE
SAYING
THAT
PEOPLE
LIKE
THIS
UH
SPONGY
FEEL
THIS
YEAR
SO
PERHAPS
UH
SOME
SOMETHING
MADE
OF
RUBBER
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105188_0105650.lab"
BUT
I
WAS
THINKING
MORE
OF
THE
BUTTONS
BECAUSE
THE
BUTTONS
WHICH
THEY'VE
THEY'VE
SAID
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0105785_0106024.lab"
THAT
THEY'VE
THEY'VE
PUT
ACROSS
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106153_0106991.lab"
ARE
WHAT
IS
USED
IN
SOME
STRESS
BALL
MANUFACTURE
AND
IT'S
MEANT
TO
BE
ANTI
R.
S.
I.
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0106991_0107867.lab"
I'M
NO
I'M
NOT
SURE
HOW
THAT
WOULD
WORK
BECAUSE
SURELY
YOUR
FINGERS
WOULD
STILL
BE
MOVING
OVER
THE
SHORT
DISTANCES
BUT
THAT'S
WHAT
THEY
SAID
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0107867_0108482.lab"
UM
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
CASING
IS
THAT
UH
THERE'S
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0108608_0109417.lab"
QUITE
UM
THERE'S
QUITE
A
FEW
DESIGN
RESTRICTIONS
THAT
THEY'VE
GOT
ON
THE
SHAPE
OF
THE
CASE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109417_0109818.lab"
IF
YOU
GO
FOR
TITANIUM
THEY
CAN
ONLY
DO
A
STANDARD
BOX
SHAPE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0109818_0110496.lab"
WHEREAS
IF
YOU
COME
TO

THEY
CAN
THEY
CAN
BE
A
LITTLE
MORE
THEY
CAN
THEY
CAN
DO
SORT
OF
CURVED
SHAPES
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0110496_0110920.lab"
BUT
WHETHER
WHETHER
OR
NOT
BECAUSE
WE'D
HAVE
IT
IN
TWO
SEPARATE

"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0111136_0111242.lab"

DON'T

IT
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
TITANIUM
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0113765_0114170.lab"
IT
WAS

IT

BUY
A
NEW

FOR
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0114170_0115100.lab"
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EXPENSE

HOW
MUCH

IT'S
LIGHT

I
THINK
IT
SHOULD
BE
LEFT

YOU
COULD
HAVE

P.
C.
B.
CIRCUIT

I'M
SURE
YOU
COULD
PROBABLY
GET
IT
IN

SO
JUST
BY
TOUCHING
IT
WITH
YOUR
FINGER
IT'D
MAKE
THE
CONNECTION
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122071_0122465.lab"
OVER
IF

TH
THEY
OFFER

"AMI_ES2004c_H02_MEE014_0122835_0123831.lab"

I
THOUGHT
THAT

THEY'RE
INCREDIBLY

DON'T

YOU
CAN
ARRANGE

AND
WE'LL
COME
TO
THAT
LATER
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0025656_0025849.lab"
SO
THAT
WAS

I
SHOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
FIRST
OF
THOSE
FINDINGS
FANCY
LOOK
AND
FEEL
IS
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0029974_0030639.lab"
IS
TWICE
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
THE
SECOND
TECHNOLOGICALLY
INNOVATIVE
WHICH
IS
IN
TURN
TWICE
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
BEING
EASY
TO
USE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0030783_0031218.lab"
SO
POSSIBLY
THAT
THE
FEATURE
THAT
WE
PUT
FIRST
IS
ACTUALLY
THIRD
IS
STILL
IMPORTANT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031218_0031695.lab"
BUT
IT'S
THIRD
IN
ORDER
OF
PREFERENCE
FOR
THE
THE
SUBJECT
GROUP
WE
LOOKED
AT
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0031695_0032413.lab"
OKAY
UM
NOW
THE
FASHION
UPDATE
WHICH
RELATES
TO
VERY
PERSONAL
PREFERENCES
AMONG
OUR
SUBJECT
GROUP
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0032413_0033086.lab"
UM
WE
FOUND
FROM
OUR
UM
CONSULTANTS
IN

WHO
DES
ATTENDED
ALL
THE
DESIGN
AND
FASHION
FAIRS
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033086_0033505.lab"
THAT
FRUIT
AND
VEGETABLES
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
THE
THEME
FOR
CLOTHES
SHOES
AND
FURNITURE
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0033505_0033912.lab"
SO
SHOULD
WE
BE
THINKING
OF
USING
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
IN
OUR
REMOTE
CONTROL
DESIGN
TOO
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034013_0034785.lab"
THERE
ALSO
SEEMS
TO
BE
UM
A

A
SPONGY

AGAIN
IN
CONTRAST
TO
LAST
YEAR
.
"AMI_ES2004c_H03_FEE016_0034785_0035432.lab"
SO
A
LOT
OF
INTERESTING
FEEDBACK
THERE
BOTH
FROM
OUR

AND
FROM
OUR
PEOPLE
IN

SHOWN
BY
YOUR

WITH
ALL
OF
THE
OTHER
CONTROLS
REMOTE
CONTROLS
NO
ONE'S
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
PARTICULARLY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193197_0193678.lab"
I
MEAN
THEY'RE
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
SO
IF
SOMEONE'S
BEEN
SHUT
IN
THE
ROOM
AND
SAID
MAKE
OURS
A
BIT
DIFFERENT
FROM
EVERYONE
ELSE'S
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0193678_0194216.lab"
\'CAUSE
IT'S
W
SOMETHING
WE
SHOULD
THINK
ABOUT

OBVIOUSLY
NO

PUT
ANY
GREAT

"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196176_0196984.lab"
BUT
THEN
WHEN
IT
EVERYTHING
IS
REALLY
SMART
AND
YOU'VE
JUST
GOT
THIS
BIG
CHUNK
OF
BLACK
THING
SITTING
ON
YOUR

TABLE
IT
DOESN'T
GO

"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0196984_0197713.lab"

THAT'S
A
PROPER
FUNKY

A
FUNKY
ITEM
THAT'S
INDIVIDUAL
INDIVIDUAL
TO
YOU

"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0197713_0198494.lab"
I
MEAN
THEY
COULD
EVEN
GO

YOU
GO
IN
WITH
AN
IDEA
AND
THEY
DESIGN
IT
ON
PHOTOSHOP
AND
THEN
THEY
JUST
GET
IT
PRINTED
ON
THE
PLASTIC
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0198494_0199206.lab"
YOU
WOULD
PRAY
YOU
WOULD
PAY
A
LOT
EXTRA
BECAUSE
IT'S
INDIVIDUALLY
BEING
A
PLASTIC
WAS
BEING
MADE
FOR
YOU
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0199206_0199556.lab"

PEOPLE
COULD
HAVE
ANYTHING

"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0203973_0204308.lab"
WELL
IT'S
INNOVATION
FOR
MONEY'S
SAKE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204308_0204544.lab"
THE
THE

"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0204806_0205290.lab"
AND
YOU
CAN'T

YOU'VE
GOT
YOUR

THAT
WORKS
FINE
BUT
YOU
CAN'T
GET

ANYMORE
FOR
THAT
TYPE
OF
PHONE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205290_0205582.lab"
BECAUSE
THE

HAVE
MOVED

"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205582_0205642.lab"
YES

"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0205778_0205904.lab"
IT'S

IN
CLOSING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206460_0206619.lab"
THERE
WE
GO
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0206619_0207514.lab"
UM
OUR
COSTS
ARE
BELOW
BUDGET
WITH
RECOMMENDATIONS
THAT
THEY
THE
BUDGET
BE
INCREASED
BUT
I
THINK
I
DON'T
KNOW
D
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0207514_0207752.lab"
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT'S
TAKES
INTO
ACCOUNT
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0207996_0208071.lab"
OVERHEADS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208156_0208471.lab"
LIKE
US
BEING
WELL
PAID
KIND
OF
A
THING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0208471_0208983.lab"
AND
THE
HEATING
FOR
THE
BUILDING
DO
YOU
THINK
OUR
BUDGET
INCLUDES
EVERYTHING
ALL
THE
COSTS
THAT
ARE
GOING
OUT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209312_0209994.lab"
SO
IT
LOOKS
WELL
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
IT'S
GONNA
BE
FIFTY
PERCENT
PROFIT
YOU'VE
STILL
GOT
ALL
OF
THE
OVERHEADS
TO
COME
OUT
OF
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0209994_0210623.lab"
SO
MAYBE
INCREASING
IT
YOU
WOULD
ALSO
HAVE
TO
INCREASE
THE
PRICE
THAT
IT'S
SOLD
AT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0210623_0210881.lab"
BUT
I
THINK
BUT
YOU

SAYING
THAT
THAT'S
QUITE

YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213317_0213646.lab"
IT'S
A
SHAME
IT
WON'T
EVER
GET
MADE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213646_0213744.lab"
MAYBE
IT
WILL
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0213744_0213984.lab"
MAYBE
SOMEONE'LL
R
RUN
DOWN
AND
PATENT
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H01_FEE013_0214271_0214736.lab"
UM
THE

HAS
BEEN
EVALUATED
WELL

OUR
FINAL

"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0014453_0015093.lab"
AND
WE'LL
FIRST
LOOK
AT
THE
EXTERIOR
OF
WHAT
WE'VE
UH
COME
UP
WITH
OVER
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015093_0015153.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015277_0015894.lab"
IT'S
GONNA
HAVE
A
A
PLASTIC
BODY
UM
WITH
A
SORT
OF
STANDARD
COLOUR
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0015894_0016555.lab"
EITHER
WE'RE
THINKING
SOME
SOMETHING
FAIRLY
NEUTRAL
LIKE
A
A
WHITE
OR
A
LIGHT
BLUE
OR
SOMETHING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0016555_0017582.lab"
THIS
IS
UNDERNEATH
THE
RUBBERISED
THE
RUBBERISED
UH
OUTER
CASING
UM
WHICH
THERE'D
BE
SORT
OF
A
WIDE
CHOICE
THEY
WOULD
BE
ATTACHED
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017582_0017838.lab"
BUT
WE
CAN
WE
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0017838_0018731.lab"
UM
THE
UM
WIDE
CHOICE
OF
COLOURS
AND
SORT
OF
PATTERNS
SO
YOU'VE
GOT
YOU'VE
GOT
A
LOT
OF
CUSTOMISATION
WITH
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0018731_0020259.lab"
UM
IT'S
OBVIOUSLY
AN
A
SORT
OF
CLAM
SHELL
DESIGN
AND
UH
THE
UM
THE
TOP
L.
C.
D.
SCREEN
THAT
YOU
CAN
SEE
THAT
WOULD
B
WOULD
BE
SORT
OF
UM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020371_0020670.lab"
HOW
DO
YOU
SAY
IT'S
YEAH
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0020670_0021549.lab"
IT
WOULD
BE
SORT
OF
INSET
INTO
THE
INTO
THE
TOP
AND
THE
BUTTONS
AT
THE
BOTTOM
WOULD
D
SO
SO
IT'LL
FULLY
CLOSE
FLAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021549_0021771.lab"
YEAH
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0021771_0022666.lab"
AND
WORKING
ON
THE
INSIDE
WE'VE
UM
ALREADY
SAID
D
DECIDED
ON
THE
KINETIC
BATTERIES
WHICH
ACTUALLY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0022666_0023422.lab"
THINKING
ABOUT
IT
NOW
COULD
Y
COULD
ALSO
PROBABLY
ATTACH
TO
THE
FLIPPING
OPEN
AND
SHUT
AS
WELL
SO
THAT
YOU
COULD
PROBABLY
GET
A
BIT
OF
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023549_0023655.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023655_0023993.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0023993_0024362.lab"
UM
WE
DECIDED
THAT
UM
THE
VOICE
RECOGNITION
SYSTEM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024362_0024997.lab"
IT
DID
ACTUALLY
SAY
ON
THE
EMAIL
THAT
THEY
WERE
SORT
OF
COMING
IN
AND
THEY
WERE
FAIRLY
EASY
TO
GET
A
HOLD
OF
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0024997_0025272.lab"
SO
WE
PRESUMED
THAT
THEY'D
ALSO
BE
QUITE
CHEAP
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025272_0025780.lab"
SO
YOU'D
HAVE
SOMETHING
LIKE
WHERE
YOU'D
SHOUT
OUT
WHERE
WHERE
IS
THE
REMOTE
AND
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0025911_0026127.lab"
IT'LL
SHOUT
BACK
I'M
HERE
OR
SOMETHING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026345_0026723.lab"
AND
THEN
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026723_0026955.lab"
IT
WO
IT
WON'T
SHOUT
OUT
I'M
HERE
OR
SOMETHING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0026955_0027532.lab"
IT'LL
JUST
SHOUT
OUT
I'M
HERE
OR
SOMETHING
TO
SIMILAR
EFFECT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0027532_0028157.lab"
UH
YEAH
IF
IT
WAS
GOING
LIKE
I
D
WELL
THA
THAT
COULD
BE
SOMETHING
FOR
NEXT
TIME
MAYBE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028157_0028476.lab"
YOU
CAN
HAVE
A
REMOTE
THAT
TELLS
YOU
EXACTLY
WHERE
IT
IS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0028476_0029174.lab"
UM
THE
STANDARD
THERE'S
BE
A
STANDARD
TRANSMISSION
WITH
THE
T.
V.
USING
USING
ALL
THE
STANDARD
CHIPS
THAT
WE'VE
TALKED
ABOUT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029174_0029767.lab"
UM
IT
WOULD
IT
WOULD
HAVE
OBVIOUSLY
\'CAUSE
IT'S
SPLIT
OVER
TWO
TWO
DIFFERENT
LAYERS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0029767_0030462.lab"
IT
WOULD
NEED
TWO
SEPARATE
P.
C.
B.
S
SO
IT
WOULD
BE
JOINED
AT
THE
HINGE
THROUGH
SOME
SORT
OF
CABLING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0030462_0031657.lab"
AND
UH
BECAUSE
OBVIOUSLY
ALL
T.
V.
S
USE
THIS
THE
SAME
INFRARED
MEDIUM
WE'D
JUST
BE
USING
USING
THE
SAME
THING
TO
TRANSMIT
THE
DATA
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031657_0031836.lab"
AND
THE
INFRARED
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0031988_0032552.lab"
UM

WOULD
BE
ON

OF
THE

"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0032552_0032972.lab"
JUST
AT
THE

HAVEN'T

DON'T

WE
ACTUALLY
PUT
IT
ON

"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033080_0033210.lab"
YEAH
YEAH
SOMETHING

YEAH
ON

ON
THE

SIDE
OF
THAT
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0033990_0034391.lab"
SO
WHEN
YOU'VE
ACTUALLY
GOT

OPEN
IT
WOULD
BE
FACING
THE
T.
V.
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0034391_0034801.lab"
AND
THEN

ON
TO
THE

"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0034801_0035814.lab"
THE

"AMI_ES2004d_H02_MEE014_0038061_0039089.lab"
AND
NOW
WE'VE
WE
ALSO
DECIDED
ON

WE
COULD
POSSIBLY
EITHER
HAVE

THIS
STAGE
OF
THE
EVALUATION
IS
REALLY
FOR
US
AS
A
TEAM
TO
EVALUATE
IF
WE
HAVE
NOW
GOT
A
PRODUCT
SPECIFICATION
AND
PROTOTYPE
DESIGN
THAT
MEETS
THE
THE
CRITERIA
THAT
WE
GOT
FROM
OUR
MARKET
RESEARCH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0046975_0047249.lab"
SO
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
STAGE
OF
THE
EVALUATION
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047249_0047547.lab"
NOW
THE
COLLECTION
OF
THE
CRITERIA
AS
WE
SAW
IN
OUR
PREVIOUS
MEETING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0047547_0048158.lab"
WAS
BASED
ON
THE
USER
REQUIREMENTS
AND
TRENDS
FOUND
IN
THE
MARKETING
REPORTS
AND
MARKETING
STRATEGY
OF
OUR
COMPANY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048158_0048619.lab"
SO
IT'S
WHAT
WE'VE
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
LAST
MEETING
ARE
WE
ACTUALLY
MEETING
THOSE
TRENDS
AND
REQUIREMENTS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0048836_0049116.lab"
NOW
THE
FINDINGS
THAT
WE
CAME
UP
WITH
JUST
A
RECAP
ARE
HERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049116_0049991.lab"
THE
CRITERIA
THAT
WE
WANT
IN
THIS
REMOTE
CONTROL
ARE
A
FANCY
LOOK
AND
FEEL
TECHNOLOGICAL
INNOVATION
IT
SHOULD
BE
EASY
TO
USE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0049991_0050845.lab"
IT
SHOULD
INCORPORATE
CURRENT
FASHION
TRENDS
AND
THOSE
THE
TWO
MAIN
ONES
THEY
WERE
THE
SPONGY
TEXTURE
AND
THE
FRUIT
AND
VEGETABLE
STRONG
DESIGN
COLOURS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0050845_0051764.lab"
THE
DESIGN
SHOULD
MINIMISE
R.
S.
I.
AND
BE
EASY
TO
LOCATE
AND
WE
WERE
STILL
UM
UH
SLIGHTLY
AMBIVALENT
AS
TO
WHETHER
TO
USE
VOICE
RECOGNITION
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0051764_0052317.lab"
THOUGH
THAT
DID
SEEM
TO
BE
THE
FAVOURED
STRATEGY
BUT
THERE
WAS
ALSO
ON
THE
SIDELINE
THE
THOUGH
OF
MAYBE
HAVING
A
BEEPER
FUNCTION
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052504_0052880.lab"
OKAY
SO
WE
CAN
COME
BACK
TO
THAT
SLIDE
IF
YOU
DON'T
HAVE
A
NOTE
OF
THOSE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0052880_0053466.lab"
I'LL
JUST
SHOW
YOU
HOW
WE'RE
GOING
TO
EVALUATE
OUR
OWN
FEEDBACK
TO
THIS
TO
WHAT
WE
HAVE
SO
FAR
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053466_0053913.lab"
WE'RE
GOING
TO
USE
A
SEVEN
POINT
SCALE
WHERE
ONE
IS
TRUE
AND
SEVEN
IS
FALSE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0053913_0054337.lab"
WE
LOOK
AT
EACH
OF
THOSE
CRITERIA
THAT
I'VE
JUST
MENTIONED
I'LL
CALL
THAT
SLIDE
BACK
UP
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0054337_0054894.lab"
AND
I
WILL
JUST
DO
A
PRELIMINARY
RATING
OF
ALL
THOSE
CRITERIA
ON
THE
WHITEBOARD
HERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0054894_0054982.lab"
DOES
THAT
SEEM
CLEAR
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0054982_0055080.lab"
ANY
QUESTIONS
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055241_0055377.lab"
SO
WE'RE
GOING
TO
LOOK
AT
THESE
CRITE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0055519_0056226.lab"
YES
WE'RE
GOING
TO
COME
TO
W
WE'LL
DISCUSS
EACH
ONE
AND
WE'LL
COME
TO
A
CONSENSUS
RATING
BETWEEN
ONE
AND
SEVEN
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056226_0056304.lab"
IS
THAT
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056304_0056520.lab"
ONE
IS
TRUE
SEVEN
IS

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056716_0056932.lab"
RIGHT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0056932_0057098.lab"
SO
I
WON'T
WRITE
ALL
OF
THAT
OUT
AGAIN
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0057098_0057436.lab"
IT
WILL
JUST
BE

AND

.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0059577_0060022.lab"
ACTUALLY
IT
MIGHT
BE
AN
IDEA
IF
WE
EACH
DID
GIVE
OUR
OWN
INDIVIDUAL
RATING
AND
WE
COULD
TAKE
AN
AVERAGE
AT
THE
END
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0060022_0060152.lab"

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0079446_0079543.lab"
RIGHT

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0079543_0080152.lab"
SO
I'M
JUST
THINKING
BEFORE
I
GIVE
IT
MY
RATING
YOU
WERE
LIMITED
IN
THE
USE
OF
MATERIALS
FOR
YOUR
PROTOTYPE
HERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0080152_0080387.lab"
IS
THIS
ACTUALLY
GOING
TO
BE
THE
COLOURS
THAT
YOU
WOULD
USE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0081067_0081096.lab"
RIGHT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0081861_0082312.lab"
SO
WE
COULD
USE
ANY
STRONG
FRUIT
AND

COLOURS
AND
THAT'S
WHAT
WE'RE
INTENDING
TO
DO
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0082312_0082405.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0082405_0082585.lab"
AND
THE

FEEL
IS
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083209_0083268.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0083501_0083683.lab"
IN
THAT
CASE
IT'S
GOT
TO
BE
A
ONE
FOR

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084046_0084098.lab"
EVERYBODY

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084098_0084139.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084388_0084676.lab"
THAT
PART
WAS
NICE
AND
EASY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084676_0084803.lab"
OKAY

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0084803_0085294.lab"
UH
MOVING

MINIMISE
REPETITIVE
STRAIN
INJURY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085499_0085694.lab"
I
DON'T
THINK
WE'VE
REALLY
TOUCHED
ON
THAT
A
LOT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0085694_0086008.lab"
WE'VE
WE'VE
DISCUSSED
IT
WE
HAVEN'T
REALLY
COME
UP
WITH
ANYTHING
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086156_0086309.lab"
WE
FELT
COULD
FEASIBLY
REDUCE
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086309_0086708.lab"
WE'VE
TALKED
ABOUT
POINTERS
BUT
THE
VERY
USE
OF
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
IF
YOU'RE
SOMEONE
WHO'S
ZAPPING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0086708_0087178.lab"
WHO'S
SITTING
LIKE
THAT
AND
WE
FOUND
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
DID
HOW
DO
YOU
MINIMISE
THAT
ON
SUCH
A
SMALL
DEVICE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0087607_0087640.lab"
MM-HMM

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0087804_0087841.lab"
MM-HMM

RIGHT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0089981_0090294.lab"
I
THINK
I'M
GONNA
HAVE
TO
BE
NEUTRAL
ON
THAT
AND
GIVE
IT
A
FOUR
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0090814_0090958.lab"
A
FIVE
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091194_0091503.lab"
FOUR
AND
A
FOUR
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091763_0091965.lab"
TWENTY
ONE
IS
THAT
TWENTY
ONE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0091965_0092202.lab"
SO
THAT'S
FOUR
POINT
TWO
FIVE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092561_0092947.lab"
AND
FINALLY
LAST
BUT
NOT
LEAST
EASY
TO
LOCATE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0092947_0093561.lab"
NOW
WE
TALKED
ABOUT
VOICE
RECOGNITION
WE
TALKED
ABOUT
A
BEEPER
HAVE
WE
REALLY
HAVE
THE
DESIGNERS
COME
TO
ANY
DEC
REAL
DECISION
ON
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0093733_0094033.lab"
IT
WAS
THE
I'M
HERE
THING
YEP
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094033_0094237.lab"
AND
ARE
WE
HAPPY
WITH
THE
COSTS
ON
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094237_0094433.lab"
THAT
IS
GOING
TO
BE
FEASIBLE
COST
WISE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094546_0094641.lab"
THAT
SOUNDS
GOOD
THEN
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0094641_0095029.lab"
I'D
GO
FOR
A
I
CA
WE
CAN
ADJUST
THE
VOLUME
ON
THAT
JUST
AS
WE
COULD
VOLUME
ON
T.
V.
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0095216_0095536.lab"
SO
IF
SOMBODY'S
IN
THE
OTHER
ROOM
OR
IF
T.
V.
S
IN
DIFFERENT
ROOMS
OR
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096168_0096226.lab"
RIGHT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096226_0096324.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096324_0096449.lab"
YOU
BUILT
INTO
THE
FEATURE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096733_0096776.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0096899_0097072.lab"
LOGICAL
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0097072_0097157.lab"
THAT'S
A
ONE
FOR
ME
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0097280_0097564.lab"
ONE
AND
ONE
GOOD
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098073_0098582.lab"
SO
HOW
DO
WE
FEEL
ABOUT
THIS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0098582_0099508.lab"
WE'VE
GOT
OUR
OUR
WE'VE
GOT
THE
HIGHEST
RATING
OF
MEETING
THE
SPECIFICATIONS
THAT
IS
DEFINITELY
TRUE
FOR
TWO
OF
THE
UH
SIX
CRITERIA
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0099508_0100102.lab"
THAT
IS
FOR
UM
INCORPORATES
CURRENT
FASHION
TRENDS
AND
IS
EASY
TO
LOCATE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0100102_0101119.lab"
THE
LOWEST
RATING
WE'VE
GOT
WHICH
IS
REALLY
N
IT'S
NOT
TERRIBLY
LOW
I
IT'S
CLOSE
AROUND
NEUTRAL
IS
FOR
UH
THE
MINIMISATION
OF
REPETITIVE
STRAIN
INJURY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101119_0101757.lab"
DO
WE
FEEL
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THA
OF
THESE
EVALUATION
FINDINGS
THAT
WE
CAN
GO
AHEAD
AND
NOW
PRODUCE
THIS
AS
A
PROTOTYPE
AND
MARKET
IT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0101757_0101958.lab"
OR
DO
WE
HAVE
TO
MAKE
FURTHER
MODIFICATIONS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102343_0102440.lab"
WE
HAPPY
TO
GO
AHEAD
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102561_0102690.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0102690_0103123.lab"
I
THINK
FOR
MOST
OF
THOSE
RATINGS
THAT
IT'S
HIGH
ENOUGH
AT
THE
UPPER
END
OF
THE
SCALE
FOR
US
TO
GO
AHEAD
WITH
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0103123_0103201.lab"
AND
I
REALLY
DOUBT
IF
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0103308_0103946.lab"
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
CURRENT
TECHNOLOGY
AND
OUR
CURRENT
CAPABILITIES
WE
COULD
ACTUALLY
DO
MUCH
MORE
TO
MINIMISE
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104035_0104199.lab"
I
KNOW
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104199_0104279.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104279_0104500.lab"
WELL
I
HOPE
THAT'S
UH
CLEAR
TO
THE
TEAM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104500_0104817.lab"
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TO
ASK
ME
ABOUT
THE
FINDINGS
BEFORE
I
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0104928_0104965.lab"
SUM
UP
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105090_0105269.lab"
GOOD
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105269_0105357.lab"
FINE
THEN
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105357_0105464.lab"
I'LL
JUST
LEAVE
IT
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0105464_0105590.lab"
OOPS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0107225_0107291.lab"
OH
YES

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0113545_0113570.lab"
YES
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119481_0119693.lab"
BUT
IT
HAS
A
SLIGHTLY
FLATTENED
BOTTOM
SO
IT
CAN
SIT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119693_0119769.lab"
SO
IT
CAN
REST
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0119933_0120168.lab"
IT
WOULD
JUST
BE
A
FLAT
BOTTOM
WITH
ONE
CURVE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0120168_0120283.lab"
LIKE
A
DOMED
THING

MM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0121063_0121404.lab"
THE
OTHER
CURVES
AT
THE
SIDES
BUT
IT'S
SLIGHTLY
FLATTENED
AT
THE
BOTTOM
SO
IT
DOESN'T
ROLL
OVER
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0121404_0121424.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0124069_0124247.lab"
WHAT
DOES
IT
MEAN
IF
YOU
PUT
POINT
FIVE
FOR
THAT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0125340_0125376.lab"
MM-HMM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0125948_0126093.lab"
RIGHT
OKAY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0126728_0127172.lab"
BUT
IT
IS
GONNA
BE
PART
OF
THE
TOTAL
COST
AND
THERE'S
NOWHERE
ELSE
WE
CAN
WE
CAN
PUT
THAT
IN
IS
THERE

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127172_0127484.lab"
THERE'S
NOWHERE

WE

THE
RUBBER
USED
IN
THE
CASING
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0127484_0127676.lab"
SO
DO
WE
NOT
HAVE
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
IT
IN
THE
COST
SOMEWHERE
THERE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0128125_0128147.lab"

MM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0129433_0129934.lab"
MIGHT
DO
IF
WE
GO
FOR
SOME
OF
THE
MORE
EXOTIC
AUBERGINES
AND
SUCH
LIKE
COLOURS

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0137074_0137087.lab"

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0162791_0162873.lab"
SO
WE'RE
OKAY

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0169656_0170315.lab"
ALTHOUGH
WE
HAD

SO
MUCH
INTERACTION
SO

THAT
WE
NEEDED
TO

BOUNCE

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0170315_0171238.lab"
AND

IN

WE'VE
BEEN
ABLE

GIVE

ADJUST
OUR

WHERE
NECESSARY
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0178734_0178763.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0180677_0181283.lab"
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
THINK
OF
BRANCHING
OUT
INTO
CHILDREN'S
TOYS

FAKE
MOBILE
PHONES
AS
A
SIDE

.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0181283_0181419.lab"

FAKE
R.
C.

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182059_0182550.lab"
HOW

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0182690_0182872.lab"

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190085_0190483.lab"
IT'S
REALLY
BORROWING
FROM
OTHER
AREAS
IT'S
YOU
KNOW
BRINGING
THINGS
FROM
OTHER
AREAS
IN
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0190483_0190922.lab"
IT
SO
IT'S
I
MEAN
NOTHING
IS
NEW
BUT
IT'S
APPLYING
IT
TO
A
D
IN
A
DIFFERENT

YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201108_0201817.lab"
I
THINK
IT'S
REALLY
GOOD
THAT
THIS
HAS
BEEN
VERY
MARKET
RESEARCH
BASED
BECAUSE
JUST
GOING
BACK
TO
MOBILE
PHONES
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0201817_0202407.lab"
I
MEAN
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
CHANGE
IN

THAT
I
CAN
REALLY
YOU

SAY
IS
IS
OBVIOUS
AND
VISIBLE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202407_0202851.lab"
WE
SEE
IT
IN
MOBILE
PHONES
A
LOT
AND
THA
THAT'S
WHERE
WE'VE
BORROWED
A
LOT
OF
OUR
IDE
OUR
IDEAS
FROM
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0202851_0203137.lab"
THERE
ARE
INNOVATIONS
IN
THAT
THAT
PEOPLE
DON'T
REALLY
WANT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203137_0203687.lab"
I
SEE
PEOPLE
WANTING
A
MODEL
OF
THE
PHONE
THEY
WERE
REALLY
HAPPY
WITH
AND
THEY
CAN'T
GET
IT
ANYMORE
AND
IT'S
INNOVATION
FOR
INNOVATION'S
SAKE
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0203687_0203961.lab"
AND
I
THINK
IT'S
WONDERFUL
OUR
COMPANY'S
SO
R.
AND
D.
BASED
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204238_0204421.lab"
YEAH

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204421_0204579.lab"
BUT
FORCING
IT
ONTO
PEOPLE
YEAH
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0204579_0204892.lab"
IT'S
THINGS
THAT

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0205906_0205983.lab"
SEE
I
THINK
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0208960_0209296.lab"
I
THINK
IT
WAS
JUST
THE
PRODUC
UH
JUST
THE

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0209723_0209771.lab"
MM-HMM

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0210855_0211119.lab"
BUT
I
THINK
IN
THE
REMIT
THAT
WE
WERE
GIVEN
IT
WAS
VERY
SPECIFIC
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211119_0211269.lab"
I
THINK
WE'VE
DONE
WHAT
WE
WERE
REQUIRED
TO
DO
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211269_0211781.lab"
AND
I
THINK
THERE'LL
HAVE
TO
BE
ANOTHER
PROJECT
TEAM
OR
A
NEW
PROJECT
FOR
US
TO
LOOK
AT
AT
THOSE
KIND
OF
THINGS
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0211781_0212244.lab"
I
DON'T
THINK
THAT'S
SOMETHING
WE
HAVE
TO
LOOK
AT

FIND
A
WAY
OF
RAISING
THE
CASH
FOR
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0212398_0213152.lab"
I
THINK
WE'VE
DONE
VERY
WELL
TO
GET
WITHIN
BUDGET
AND
IT
STILL
MAKES
SUCH
AN
INNOVATIVE
ITEM
THAT
I
THINK
PEOPLE
ARE
REALLY
GONNA
WANT
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213477_0213648.lab"
I
KNOW

"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213648_0213692.lab"
MAYBE
IT
WILL
.
"AMI_ES2004d_H03_FEE016_0213692_0214036.lab"
MAYBE
THEY
ARE
GONNA
STEAL
OUR

"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0153384_0154275.lab"
ON
MY
SLIDE
SHOW
BASICALLY
WE
ALREADY
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
DONE
THE
AGENDA
AND
UH
ON
THE

UH
BASICALLY
THERE
WILL
BE
LUNCH
BREAK
AND
ALL
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0154275_0155070.lab"
HOWEVER
UH
THE
DECISION
WE
HAVE
TO
TAKE
IN
THIS
MEETING
IS
WHO
IS
OUR
TARGET
GROUP
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155070_0155734.lab"
AND
UH
WHAT
FUNCTION
WORKING
DESIGN
HOW
HOW
DOES
IT
WORK
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0155734_0156064.lab"
SO
THESE
ARE
THE
TWO
THINGS
WE
SHOULD
COME
UP
WIT
WITH
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0156064_0156654.lab"
SO
UH
THE
FIRST
THING
IS
PRO
MAYBE
A
LITTLE
EASIER
ON
UH
WHO
IS
OUR
TARGET
GROUP
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0156821_0156883.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157093_0157263.lab"
I
GUESS
IN
MANY
WAYS
EVERYBODY
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157448_0157621.lab"
EVERYBODY
WHO
HAS
A
T.
V.
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0157798_0158314.lab"
YEAH
AND
I
THINK
TODAY
THERE
ARE
PROBABLY
NOT
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
DON'T
HAVE
A
T.
V.
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158314_0158496.lab"
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
BUT
IN
GENERAL
NOT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0158673_0159520.lab"
NOW
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
TARGET
GROUP
WHICH
IS
IN
A
SENSE
EVERYBODY
BUT
I
THINK
WITHIN
THE
TARGET
GROUP
WE
HAVE
SUBGROUPS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0159520_0160519.lab"
WE
HAVE
WE
HAVE
EARLIER
IT
WAS
MENTIONED
ABOUT
UM
FOR
EXAMPLE
ELDERLY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
LIMITED
FUNCTION
WITH
THEIR
FINGERS
AND
HANDS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160519_0160975.lab"
SO
I
THINK
THAT'S
UH
ONE
GROUP
THAT'S
CERTAINLY
IMPORTANT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0160975_0161845.lab"
UM
THEN
WE
HAVE
JUST
THE
NERVOUS
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
NEVER
PRESS
A
LITTLE
BUTTON
ON
ANYTHING
UM
UNLESS
IT'S
REALLY
VERY
CLEAR
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0161845_0162455.lab"
AND
UH
I
DON'T
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
WE
WANT
TO
CATER
TO
CHILDREN'S
USE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0162455_0163223.lab"
I
MEAN
THAT'S
A
QUESTION
UM
WHETHER
THAT'S
IMPORTANT
THAT
CHILDREN
CAN
REALLY
USE
IT
OR
NOT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163447_0163714.lab"
SO
THIS
THESE
ARE
JUST
SOME
THOUGHTS
I
HAVE
ON
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0163714_0165367.lab"
AND
UM
I
DUNNO
WHAT
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
WHETHER
WE
CAN
JUST
SAY
WE
HAVE
ONE
TARGET
GROUP
AND
FOR
THIS
ONE
TARGET
GROUP
WE'RE
GONNA
DESIGN
THIS
ONE
THING
OR
WHETHER
WE'RE
LOOKING
AT
WHAT
WE
LIKE
WE
WE
TALKING
ABOUT
DIFFERENT
SHAPES
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0165367_0166225.lab"
WHETHER
THAT
DIFFERENT
SHAPE
ALSO
INCLUDES
MAYBE
DIFFERENT
UH
BUTTONS
UH
FOR
DIFFERENT

.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0166688_0166727.lab"
MM-HMM
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0167876_0168847.lab"
THAT
HAS
A
LOT
OF
THAT
HAS
A
LOT
OF
APPEAL
BUT
I
THINK
UH
I'M
I'M
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
FUNCTIONALITY
NOW
ON
IT
WHETHER
WE'RE
LOOKING
AT
DIFFERENT
GROUPS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0168847_0169322.lab"
I
THINK
THE
CHILDREN
ISSUE
CAN
BE
ADDRESSED
WITH
THE
SHAPE
AND
WITH
COLOURS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0169322_0170178.lab"
YOU
KNOW
LIKE
YOU
MAKE
IT
NICE

PINK
FLUORESCENT
BANANA

WHATEVER
YOU
KNOW
YEAH
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
KNOW
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170178_0170467.lab"
BUT
THE
QUESTION
IS
REALLY
WHO
IS
OUR
TARGET
GROUP
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170623_0170867.lab"
DO
WE
LOOK
AT
ONE
TARGET
GROUP
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0170984_0172090.lab"
AND
WITH
THE
TWENTY
FIVE
EUROS
YOU
KNOW
CAN
WE
CAN
WE
AFFORD
TO
HAVE
UH
I'M
ASKING
THE
TECHNICAL
PEOPLE
HERE
WHETHER
UM
TO
LOOK
AT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0172297_0172966.lab"
SORT
OF
SUBGROUPS
WITH
MAYBE
DIFFERENT
BUTTONS
FOR
EACH

HOW
MUCH
WOULD
THAT
THROW
US
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0173074_0173490.lab"
OUT
OF
THE
COST
WE
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
RESPECT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0174714_0174751.lab"
RIGHT

"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179156_0179208.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179414_0179502.lab"
NO
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0179785_0180380.lab"
THE
THE
QUEST
THE
QUESTION
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
HERE
IS
ONLY
WHO
IS
THE
TARGET
GROUP
AND
HOW
WILL
IT
FUNCTION
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0180380_0181272.lab"
AND
I
THINK
THE
HOW
WILL
IT
FUNCTION
IS
PROBABLY
THE
QUESTION
OF
THE
BUTTONS
YOU
KNOW
WITHIN
THE
TARGET
GROUP
OR
SUBGROUPS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0181272_0182218.lab"
THE
QUESTION
IS
ONLY
WHETHER
OUR
BUDGET
WILL
ALLOW
TO
HAVE
MORE
THAN
ONE
DESIGN
IN
A
SENSE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182218_0182431.lab"
I
MEAN
THE
BASIC
DESIGN
I
UNDERSTAND
WILL
BE
THE
SAME
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0182431_0183428.lab"
BUT
THE
QUESTION
IS
HOW
MUCH
WILL
THAT
SET
US
BACK
IF
LET'S
SAY
UH
FORTY
PERCENT
WE
MAKE
LARGE
BUTTONS
AND
THE
REST
WE
MAKE
REGULAR
BUTTONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0183533_0184353.lab"
SO
THAT
REMAINS
TO
S
TO
BE
SEEN
BUT
UH
THE
TARGET
GROUP
AS
A
WHOLE
IS
IS
BASICALLY
EVERYBODY
WITH
A
T.
V.
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0185553_0185747.lab"
YEAH
WELL
THAT'S
THAT'S
THE
QUESTION
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0186847_0187426.lab"
WELL
MAYBE
THERE'S
THERE'S
AN
IDEA
YOU
KNOW
T
THE
NEW
FOR
EXAMPLE
NEW
PORTABLE
PHONES
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187426_0187816.lab"
THEY
HAVE
LIKE
REMOVABLE
PLASTIC
CASES
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0187816_0188477.lab"
SO
YOU
CAN
HAVE
A

YOU
CAN
HAVE
A

ONE
OR
WHATEVER
AND
MAYBE
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H00_FIE088_0188477_0190040.lab"
THAT
IN

YOU

YOU
HAVE
YOU

FOR
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0124081_0125332.lab"
UH
A

SHOULD

CAN
SIT
ANYWHERE

IN

OF

"AMI_IS1009b_H01_FIO087_0125332_0126793.lab"
THERE
SHOULD

OF

SLI
SLIDE
PLEASE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0061832_0062592.lab"
THE
METAL
IS
LIKE
UH
IN
A
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
YOU
HAVE
A
CHIP
INTEGRATED
CIRCUIT
WHICH
IS
LIKE
A
BRAIN
OF
THE
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0062592_0063941.lab"
IT
TAKES
THE
POWER
FROM
A
BATTERY
SAY
A
BATTERY
IT
IT
CAN
BE
A
ELEC
AN
ELECTRIC
SUPPLY
LIKE
YOU
HAVE
TO
UH
LIKE
UH
SWITCH
CONNEC
CONNECT
CONNECT
YOUR
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
TO
UH
POWER
SUPPLY
FROM
THE
YOU
KNOW
ELECTRICITY
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0063941_0066293.lab"
IT
SHOULD
BE
A
BATTERY
BECAUSE
UH
UH
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
SHOULD
BE
LIKE
YOU
YOU
YOU
SHOULD
TAKE
IT
T
TO
WHEREVER
YOU
WANT
AND
THEN
UM
UH
TH
THIS
INTEGRATED
CIRCUITRY
TAKES
ENERGY
FROM
THE
POWER
SOURCE
AND
WHATEVER
LIKE
IF
YOU
PRESS
A
BUTTON
IT'S
LIKE
A
INPUT
FOR
THE
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
AND
IT
TAKES
THE
INPUT
AND
IT
IT
TRANSFORMS
INTO
A
INFRO
INFRARED
BITS
AND
IT
SENDS
IT
INTO
THE
DEVICE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066293_0066601.lab"
LIKE
A
T.
V.
OR
A
AIR
CONDITIONER
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
SO
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0066643_0067027.lab"
UH
A
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
IS
SPECIFICALLY
DESIGNED
TO
A
SINGLE
DEVICE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0067027_0068629.lab"
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
DESIGN
IT
FOR
MULTIPLE
DEVICES
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
MAKE
ALL
THE
DEVICES
COMPATIBLE
WITH
THE
FREQUENCY
LIKE
UH
TH
THE
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
IT
SENDS
SOME
BITS
SOME
UH
WAVES
LIKE
WITH
A
PARTICULAR
FREQUENCY
THE
DEVICE
SHOULD
KNOW
WHAT
THE
FREQUENCY
IS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0068629_0070147.lab"
IT
SHOULD
RE
RE
RECOGNISE
THE
UH
WAVES
WHICH
ARE
COMING
FROM
THE
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
AND
IT
SHOULD
TAKE
THE
ACTION
LIKE
IF
YOU
PRESS
A
BUTTON
CHANNEL
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
THEN
UH
THE
REMOTE
UH
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
WILL
SEND
A
SEND
A
SE
SEND
A
SIGNAL
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070147_0070757.lab"
AND
THE
T.
V.
IT
SHOULD
TRANSLATE
THAT
INTO
LIKE
CHANGE
THE
CHANNEL
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0070757_0071600.lab"
CHANGE
THE
VOLUME
CONTROL
AND
UH
SO
UH
I
THINK
IT'S
HARD
TO
DESIGN
A
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
FOR
MULTIPLE
UH
DEVICES
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0071851_0071905.lab"
UH
YEAH
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0072352_0072403.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0072628_0073653.lab"
SO
UH
USER
INTERFACE
CONTROLS
THE
CHIP
AND
ACCORDINGLY
THE
MESSAGES
LIKE
THERE
SHOULD
BE
A
USER
USER
IN

LIKE
YOU
KNOW

OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
BUTTONS
SHOULD
BE
THERE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0073653_0073867.lab"
SO
UH
YOU
CAN
CONTROL
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0073867_0076040.lab"
YOU
WANT
TO

YOU
WANT
TO

THE

YOU
YOU
WANT
TO

MUTE
UH
MUTE
THE

T.
V.
OR
YOU
WANT
TO
HAVE
A

YOU
WANT
TO
DO
SOME
OPERATIONS
THERE'S
A
THERE
SHOULD
BE
SOME

TO
TELL
WHAT
TO
DO
TO
THE
UH
IN
UH
INTEGRATED

SO
THAT
THE
INTEGRATED

CAN

SEND

V.
CAN
PERFORM
THE

"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0076111_0076315.lab"

CAN
YOU
GO
TO
THE
NEXT
SLIDE
PLEASE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0076382_0077721.lab"
SO
I
I
JUST
WOULD
LIKE
TO
UH
ADD
SOME
EXTRA
FEATURES
TO
THE

CONTROLLER
UM
I
THINK
THESE
ARE
THE
VERY
SIMPLE
FEATURES
AND
UH
THEY
DON'T
TAKE
MUCH
UH
UH
MUCH
OF
THE
UM
UM
INVESTMENT
ALSO
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0077721_0079412.lab"
IT'S
LIKE
EL
THE

WHICH
UH
WHICH
ARE
THERE
ON
THE

THEY
THOSE
WE
CAN
MAKE
UH
UM

UH
THEY'LL
BE

SO
THAT
YOU
CAN

IF
IT
IS
DARK
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0079506_0081211.lab"
AND
THER
THERE
SHOULD
BE

ARE

SUPPOSE
A

PLAYING
WITH
THE
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
AND
A
AND
SHE
SHE
OR
HE
IS
PRESSING
THE

THERE
SHOULD

YOU

A

"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081211_0081515.lab"

"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0081690_0083182.lab"
LIKE
UH
UH
YOU

THAT

WHATEVER

"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0083182_0084080.lab"
IF
MAKE

IT'S

"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0090440_0091106.lab"
AND
AND
THE
BUTTO
BUTTONS
ALSO
I
THINK
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
HAVE
MORE
FEATURES
IN
YOUR
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
THEN
THERE
SHOULD
BE
MORE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091106_0091392.lab"
IF
THERE
ARE
MORE

THEN
IT
WILL
BE
MORE
COMPLICATED
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091392_0091748.lab"
IF
YOU
HAVE
LESS

THEN
YOUR
REMOTE
CONTROLLER
WON'T
BE
ATTRACTIVE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0091748_0092561.lab"
SO
I
THINK
UH
WE
NEED
TO
MAKE
SOME
BUTTONS
WHICH
ARE
WHICH
ARE
LIKE
UM
UH
F
IN
UH
IN
INTENDED
FOR
TWO
OR
THREE
OPERATIONS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0092561_0093299.lab"
LIKE
IF
YOU
PRESS
ONE

IN

THEN
IT
WILL
CHANGE
THE

IF
YOU
PRESS
THE
OTHER

IN
ANOTHER
MODE
IT
WILL
CHANGE
THE

.
"AMI_IS1009b_H02_FIO084_0093299_0093901.lab"
SO
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
HAVE
LESS

WE
CAN
HAVE
THAT
OPTION
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WILL
COMPLICATE
THE
MATTER
MORE

SO
THE
FUNCTIONAL

WHY
DON'T
WE
PASS
RIGHT
TO
THE
SECOND
SLIDE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012069_0012334.lab"
CAUSE
THAT'S
WHERE
M
MY
DISCUSSION
STARTS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0012334_0013030.lab"
RIGHT
WELL
UM
SINCE
I'M
IN
CHARGE
OF
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
WE
SHOULD
PUT
ON
THIS
THING
SINCE
I
HAVE
TO
TRY
TO
SELL
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0013030_0013619.lab"
UM
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
METHOD
I
SHOULD
FOLLOW
WOULD
BE
GATHER
SUGGESTIONS
FROM
EVERYBODY
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0013619_0014672.lab"
AND
TH
THE
REASON
I
JUST
PUT
THAT
THERE
LIKE
THAT
IS
THAT
UH
IN
THE
INIT
IN
THE
INITIAL
STAGE
I
THINK
I
SHOULD
JUST
BE
OPEN
TO
LOTS
OF
SUGGESTIONS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0014672_0015069.lab"
YOU
KNOW
YOU
CAN
SAY
ANYTHING
YOU
WANT
NO
MATTER
HOW
SILLY
IT
SOUNDS
YOU
KNOW
IT
SHOULD
RUN
YOUR
CAR
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0015069_0016531.lab"
IT
SHOULD
HEAT
UP
YOUR
MOTOR
IF
SHOULD
UM
TURN
ON
YOUR
C.
D.
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
IT
TO
DO
UM
AND
THEN
AS
WE
GO
ON
WHAT
WE'LL
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
ACCEPT
AND
ELIMINATE
THESE
SUGGESTIONS
ACCORDING
TO
UM
DESIGN
AND
BUDGET
FEASIBILITY
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0016562_0017633.lab"
SO
I'LL
BE
COMING
TO
YOU
UM
FREQUENTLY
AS
THE
INDUSTRIAL
EXPERT
TO
TELL
ME
HOW
HARD
IT'S
GONNA
BE
TO
ADD
A
FEATURE
OR
HOW
EXPENSIVE
IT'S
GONNA
BE
OR
IF
YOUR
TIME
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0017633_0018011.lab"
IF
IT
TAKES
FIVE
YEARS
TO
DEVELOP
THIS
IT'S
JUST
SOMETHING
WE
CAN'T
DO
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018011_0018921.lab"
SO
IN
THE
BEGINNING
JUST
HAVE
A
BIG
PUDDLE
OF
THINGS
THAT
WE
ANYBODY
CAN
TH
THROW
ANYTHING
IN
AND
THEN
JUST
WEED
THINGS
OUT
THAT
CAN'T
BE
DONE
FOR
ONE
REASON
OR
ANOTHER
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0018921_0019778.lab"
AND
THEN
THE
THINGS
THAT
SEEM
THE
MOST
ATTRACTIVE
THAT
TO
UH
TO
A
CUSTOMER
WE'LL
TRY
TO
THEN
PRIORITISE
THOSE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0019778_0020047.lab"
SO
THAT
WAS
UM
WHAT
I
MEANT
THERE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020047_0020887.lab"
AND
AS
I
SAID
ON
THE
SLIDE
THERE
CONSULTING
THE
INDUSTRIAL
ENGINEER
ABOUT
THAT
AND
THE
OTHER
THING
IS
TIMING
IS
REALLY
GONNA
BE
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
MONEY
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0020887_0021322.lab"
BECAUSE
IF
WE'RE
GONNA
SELL
THIS
THING
I
THINK
THE
BEST
TIME
TO
SELL
IT
IS
AS
A
CHRISTMAS
PRESENT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021364_0021801.lab"
TWENTY
FIVE
EUROS
MAKES
A
NICE
LITTLE
PRESENT
AND
WE
WANT
IT
TO
BE
AN
IMPULSE
PURCHASE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0021801_0022222.lab"
WE
WANT
SOMEBODY
TO
SEE
IT
AND
THINK
IT'S
GEE
I
JUST
GOTTA
HAVE
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022222_0022406.lab"
AND
TAKE
OUT
THEIR
WALLET
AND
BUY
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022406_0022828.lab"
SO
IT'S
GOTTA
BE
REALLY
ATTRACTIVE
AND
IT
BUT
IT'S
GOTTA
GO
TO
MARKET
BY
SEPTEMBER
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0022828_0023485.lab"
\'CAUSE
ANYTHING
THAT
YOU
DON'T
ALREADY
HAVE
OUT
THERE
IN
SEPTEMBER

BE
COMING

TRY

SO
I'LL

HOW
MUCH
IS
IT
GONNA
COST

HOW
LONG
IS
IT
GONNA
TAKE

AND
I'LL
BE
COMING
TO
YOU
TO
TELL
ME
WHAT'S
GONNA
MAKE
SOMEBODY
TAKE
OUT
THEIR
WALLET
YOU
KNOW
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0027101_0027851.lab"
WHAT
WHAT'S
WHAT'S
GONNA
REALLY
BE
WHAT
THEY
CALL
A
SIZZLE
\'CAUSE
WE
GOTTA
SELL
THIS
SIZZLE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0027851_0029054.lab"
A
LOT
OF
TIMES
THE
THING
THAT
WORKS
THE
BEST
FROM
AN
ENGINEERING
POINT
OF
VIEW
ISN'T
THE
THING
THAT
SOMEBODY'S
REALLY
JUST
GONNA
TAKE
OUT
THEIR
WALLET
AND
BUY
FOR
CHRISTMAS
FOR
FOR
THEIR
CHILD
OR
FOR
THEIR
HUSBAND
OR
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0029054_0029206.lab"
OKAY
CAN
WE
GO
TO
THE
NEXT
SLIDE
PLEASE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0029486_0030625.lab"
ALRIGHT
I
I
ALREADY
DID
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
RESEARCH
AFTER
OUR
FIRST
MEETING
WHERE
WE
THREW
OUT
SOME
IDEAS
AND
IT
LOOKS
TO
ME
THAT
WITHIN
THE
BUDGET
THAT
WE'RE
LOOKING
AT
THE
UH
THE
WHOLE
HOUSE
IDEA
REALLY
ISN'T
GONNA
BE
POSSIBLE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0030625_0031175.lab"
SO
I'D
LIKE
YOUR
SUGGESTIONS
TO
COME
BACK
TO
THE
OTHER
SLIDE
WHERE
I
WAS
SAYING
WE
WE
COULD
SUGGEST
ANYTHING
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031175_0031708.lab"
I'D
LIKE
THE
SUGGESTIONS
TO
BE
REALLY
SPECIFIC
SO
THAT
WE'LL
HAVE
A
LIST
OF
THINGS
WE
CAN
CROSS
OFF
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0031708_0032924.lab"
NOT
SOMETHING
LIKE
YOU
KNOW
WHOLE
HOUSE
CONTROL
WHAT'LL
BE
AND
THEN
I
FOUND
ON
THE
INTERNET
FROM
FROM
MY
RESEARCH
THAT
SOME
EXTENDED
ELECTRONIC
ENTERTAINMENT
CONTROL
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0032924_0033501.lab"
AT
THE
BUDGET
THAT
WE'RE
LOOKING
AT
AND
AT
THE
PRICE
POINT
WE'RE
LOOKING
AT
WE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
IT
WORK
THE
T.
V.
THE
V.
C.
R.
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0033501_0034381.lab"
THE
STEREO
SET
UM
MAYBE
SOMETHING
ELSE
CUTE
LIKE
A
COFFEE
POT
OR
ONE
OTHER
APPLIANCE
OR
MAYBE
A
LAMP
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0034381_0034459.lab"
I
HAVE
TO
WIND
UP
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0034568_0034638.lab"
YEAH
SURE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0035320_0035360.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0036111_0036146.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0038132_0038212.lab"
OF
COURSE
YEAH
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0038308_0038440.lab"
OKAY
SO
THAT'S
SOMETHING
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0041820_0041895.lab"
OKAY
SO
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042540_0042574.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042700_0042838.lab"
ALRIGHT
THANKS
FOR
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0042838_0043738.lab"
UM
ALRIGHT
NOW
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
I
FOUND
OUT
ON
IN
MY
RESEARCH
IS
THAT
THE
COMPLAINTS
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
ABOUT
THE
REMOTE
CONTROLS
THAT
ARE
OUT
THERE
NOW
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0043738_0044093.lab"
\'CAUSE
A
LOT
OF
THEM
TAKE
TOO
MUCH
TIME
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
USE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044093_0044900.lab"
AND
THAT
WAS
THIRTY
FOUR
PERCENT
BUT
EVEN
MORE
IMPORTANT
THE
THING
THAT
WE
DID
ADDRESS
IN
OUR
LAST
MEETING
THAT
FREQUENTLY
IT'S
LOST
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
ROOM
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0044900_0045388.lab"
UM
SO
THOSE
ARE
TWO
THINGS
THAT
WE
DEFINITELY
DO
WANNA
ADDRESS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0045388_0046099.lab"
UH
WE
WANNA
S
MAKE
IT
AS
SIMPLE
AS
POSSIBLE
WE
WANNA
MAKE
IT
UM
OBVIOUS
AND
INTUITIVE
TO
USE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0046099_0047160.lab"
AND
THEN
THE
THINGS
ABOUT
FINDING
IT
WE
TALKED
ABOUT
THE
A
LIGHT
EMITTING
THING
AS
WELL
AS
UH
MAYBE
A
BEEP
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047160_0047734.lab"
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THOSE
ARE
THINGS
AFTER
MY
RESEARCH
THAT
WE
DEFINITELY
WANNA
TRY
TO
INCORPORATE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047734_0047873.lab"
\'KAY
CAN
WE
GO
TO
THE
NEXT
SLIDE
PLEASE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0047965_0048737.lab"
OKAY
SO
MY
PERSONAL
PREFERENCES
IN
THIS
UM
PROJECT
ARE
REALLY
HAVE
TO
CONCENTRATE
ON
THE
SIZZLE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0048737_0049169.lab"
THAT
IS
THE
SELLING
POINT
THE
THING
THAT'S
GONNA
MAKE
IT
AN
IMPULSE
PURCHASE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049169_0049802.lab"
UH
BECAUSE
ONCE
THERE'S
NO
BE
BACK
WELL
IN
SALES
THEY
ALWAYS
SAY
YOU
KNOW
BE
BACKS
DON'T
COME
BACK
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0049802_0050107.lab"
IF
SOMEBODY
SAYS
OH
I'LL
COME
BACK
AND
GET
IT
NEXT
WEEK
YOU'RE
DEAD
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050107_0050250.lab"
THEY'RE
NEVER
GONNA
COME
BACK
AND
BUY
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0050250_0050983.lab"
YOU'VE
GOTTA
MAKE
IT
ATTRACTIVE
ENOUGH
SO
THEY
BUY
IT
NOW
NOW
NOW
W
NOW
IS
A
BIG
WORD
IN
IN
MY
BOOK
FOR
SELLING
THIS
THING
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051054_0051832.lab"
AND
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
IT
REALLY
SELLABLE
WE'VE
GOTTA
SHORTEN
THE
LEARNING
CURVE
MAKE
SURE
IT'S
REALLY
INTUITIVE
AND
EASY
TO
USE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0051832_0052603.lab"
WE
HAVE
TO
HAVE
AS
FEW
BUTTONS
AS
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
MORE
BUTTONS
IS
MORE
CONFUSION
SO
THAT'S
WHY
I'M
SAYING
SIMPLICITY
IS
GOOD
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052603_0052895.lab"
FINDING
IT'S
IMPORTANT
OBVIOUSLY
YOU
CAN'T
USE
IT
IF
YOU
CAN'T
FIND
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0052895_0053566.lab"
SO
WE'VE
GOTTA
CONCENTRATE
ON
THE
FEATURES
THAT
HELP
YOU
FIND
IT
AND
I'VE
ALREADY
SAID
THIS
SEVERAL
TIMES
BUT
I
PUT
IT
DOWN
IN
WRITING
HERE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053566_0053911.lab"
IT
SHOULD
BE
AN
ATTRACTIVE
IMPULSE
PURCHASE
AT
TWENTY
FIVE
EUROS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0053911_0054476.lab"
SO
IT
HAS
TO
HAVE
ENOUGH
VALUE
THAT
WHEN
SOMEBODY
LOOKS
AT
IT
THEY
SAY
UH
TWENTY
FIVE
EUROS
I'M
NOT
GONNA
TAKE
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054476_0054921.lab"
HAS
TO
BE
SO
GREAT
THAT
THEY'RE
GONNA
SAY
UH
TWENTY
FIVE
EUROS
ISN'T
MUCH
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0054921_0055696.lab"
UM
AND
THEN
MAYBE
A
MOTTO
LIKE
WE
PUT
FASHION
IN
ELECTRONICS
MIGHT
BE
SOMETHING
WE
CAN
USE
IN
OUR
MARKETING
CAMPAIGN
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0055696_0055895.lab"
OKAY
THAT'S
UH
ABOUT
IT
FOR
ME
RIGHT
NOW
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0061329_0061363.lab"

YEAH
WELL
THAT'S
ALREADY
BEEN
ELIMINATED
BY
MANAGEMENT
SO
WE'RE
OFF
THE
HOOK

"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0075399_0075459.lab"

WELL
WE
ALREADY
ELIMINATED
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085300_0085700.lab"
NOW
THAT'S
GOOD
FROM
A
MARKETING
POINT
OF
VIEW
THE
FUN
THE
FUN
SHAPE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085700_0085982.lab"
AND
THAT
YOU
YOU
SAY
THAT
WON'T
ADD
TOO
MUCH
TO
THE
BUDGET
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0085982_0086172.lab"
TO
D
THE
SHAPE
IS
UH
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0087557_0088267.lab"
DO
YOU
THINK
THERE'S
ANY
CHANCE
OF
UM
HAVING
SER
IN
HAVING
BASICALLY
THE
SAME
MACHINE
WITH
THE
SAME
BUTTONS
BUT
MAYBE
SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
SHAPES
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0088416_0088504.lab"
IS
THAT
GONNA
BE
A
POSSIBLE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0088504_0088682.lab"
\'CAUSE
THAT
MIGHT
HELP
WITH
THE
MARKETING
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0089144_0090328.lab"
BECAUSE
WE
HAD
SOMETHING
SORT
OF
SEXY
FOR
ADULTS
AND
WE
COULD
HAVE
SOMETHING
SORT
OF
SILLY
FOR
CHILDREN
OR
A
LITTLE
ANIMAL
SHAPE
OR
IN
A
OR
A
LITTLE
ELEPHANT
SO
THEY
CAN
REMEMBER
WHERE
IT
IS
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0093425_0093497.lab"
MM
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0093861_0093904.lab"
WELL
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0093904_0094930.lab"
I
THINK
I
THINK
THAT
THAT'S
SOMETHING
THAT
WE'LL
HAVE
TO
DISCUSS
UM
WITH
THE
USER
INTERFACE
PERSON
BECAUSE
I
THINK
THERE'S
A
LOT
OF
ARGUMENT
TO
BE
MADE
FOR
ONE
BUTTON
FOR
ONE
FEATURE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0094930_0095705.lab"
BECAUSE
I
THINK
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
WERE
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
IN
MY
WHAT
I
FOUND
OUT
IN
MY
RESEARCH
IS
WHEN
THEY
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
HOW
HARD
IT
IS
TO
LEARN
A
NEW
ONE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0095705_0096316.lab"
THE
CHANGING
MODES
WAS
SOMETHING
I
MEAN
YOU
AND
I
ALL
F
ALL
FOUR
OF
US
WE
WORK
WITH
COMPUTERS
ALL
THE
TIME
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096316_0096672.lab"
CHANGING
MODES
IS
NOTHING
FOR
US
BUT
PEOPLE
WHO
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0096845_0096954.lab"
N
AND
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0097752_0098520.lab"
AND
THAT'S
AND
THAT'S
THE
KIND
OF
THING
PEOPLE
LEARN
BY
FEEL
AND
UM
YOU
DON'T
FEEL
THE
MODE
CHANGE
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0098520_0099118.lab"
SO
UM
MAYBE
HAVING
BUTTONS
BE
VARIOUS
SHAPES
MIGHT
BE
A
HELP
TOO
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0099118_0100076.lab"
YOU
KNOW
LIKE
THE
A
TRIANGLE
IS
FOR
THE
VOLUME
AND
A
SQUARE
IS
FOR
CHANGING
CHANNELS
SO
THAT
PEOPLE
CAN
UH
DEVELOP
A
TACTILE
SENSE
OF
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0100076_0100251.lab"
BUT
WE'LL
GET
TO
THAT
WITH
YOU
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0100587_0100676.lab"
THAT'S
RIGHT
YEAH
.
"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0100676_0100766.lab"
NOW
THAT'S
A
GOOD

"AMI_IS1009b_H03_FIO089_0102143_0102905.lab"
YEAH
THAT'S
THAT'S
A

NOW
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
FEATURE
I
WOULD

BE
THE
SPEECH
RECOGNITION
FEATURE
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049045_0049572.lab"
IT'S
AN
INTEGRATED
PROGRA
PROGRAMMABLE
SAMPLE
SENSOR
SPEAKER
UNIT
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0049852_0050709.lab"
SO
A

CAN
BE
TH
CAN
BE
UH

HAVE
THE
VOICE
RECOGNISERS
YOU
CAN
RECORD
YOUR

"AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0051039_0051517.lab"
WHICH

HAVE
SOME
RECOGNISER

WILL
RECOGNISE
THE

AND
ACCORDINGLY
IT
WILL
CHANGE
ITS
FUNCTIONALITIES
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0053586_0053930.lab"

THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE

FEATURE
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
CAN
HAVE
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H01_FIO087_0054117_0054527.lab"

ALRIGHT
MY

UH
I'M
INTERESTED

MAKE
OURSELVES
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE

.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0139591_0140222.lab"
SO
I'VE
REALLY
BEEN
LOOKING
AT
THE
PRESS
AND
THE
ADS
THAT
ARE
OUT
THERE
FOR
OTHER
REMOTE
CONTROLLERS
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140222_0140793.lab"
I
S
I
SPEND
A
LOT
OF
TIME
ON
THE

SURFING
AROUND
DOING
THE
SAME
THING
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0140793_0141346.lab"
AND
THEN
WHEN

OR
ANYTHING
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141346_0141886.lab"
I
TRY
TO
NOTICE
WHAT
KIND
OF
REMOTE
CONTROLS
PEOPLE
HAVE
AND
IF
IT'S
CONVENIENT
IN
THE
CONVERSATION
I
ASK
ABOUT
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0141886_0142148.lab"
AND
I
WOULD
ENCOURAGE

DO
THE
SAME
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142148_0142685.lab"
UM
AND
MY
FINDINGS
FROM
THIS
IS
THAT
YOU
KNOW
SMALL
IS
BEAUTIFUL
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0142685_0143016.lab"
UM
PEOPLE
LIKE

THAT
REALLY
FITS
IN

.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143016_0143144.lab"
SIMPLE
IS
BEAUTIFUL
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143144_0143839.lab"
THEY
DON'T
WANT
TO
HAVE
TO
SQUINT
AT
SMALL
PRINT
UM
THEY
WANT
BUTTONS
WHOSE
FUNCTIONS
ARE
OBVIOUS
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0143839_0144355.lab"
AND
THEY
WANT
UM
AS
FEW
BUTTONS
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
THEY
DON'T
CARE
FOR
THE
MODE
THING
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144355_0144558.lab"
THEY
WANT
EACH
BUTTON
TO
DO
SOMETHING
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144558_0144676.lab"
AND
EYE
CATCHING
IS
IMPORTANT
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144676_0144923.lab"
IT'S
GOTTA
LOOK
CUTE
IT'S
GOTTA

APPEALING

"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0144923_0145145.lab"
GO
AHEAD
I'M
TRYING
TO
FINISH
FAST
FOR
YOU
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145145_0145782.lab"
UM
AND
OUR
PREFERENCE
IS
AS
FAR
AS
I'M
CONCERNED
ARE
WE
GOT
TO
GET
TO
THE
MARKET
BEFORE
THE
COMPETITION
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0145782_0146250.lab"
OURS
HAS
TO
BE
LOOK
REALLY
GREAT
AND
IT
HAS
TO
COME
OUT
BEFORE
THE
OTHERS
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146250_0146840.lab"
SO
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
LEG
UP
ON
TIME
TO
SELL
IT
AND
PUSH
IT
BEFORE
OTHER
PEOPLE
GET
OUT
THEIR
CHRISTMAS
ITEM
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0146840_0147354.lab"
AND
WE
SHOULD
DEVELOP
ONE
OR
TWO
FEATURES
WE
CAN
REALLY
DWELL
ON
IN
OUR
AD
CAMPAIGN
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0147354_0148032.lab"
IF
WE
TRY
TO
TELL
PEOPLE
IT
HAS
TOO
MANY
GREAT
FEATURES
UM
THE
CONSUMER
JUST
GETS
CONFUSED
AND
WE
DON'T
GET
ANYWHERE
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148032_0148872.lab"
SO
WE'VE
GOTTA
NARROW
OUR
SELECTION
DOWN
TO
LI
TWO
THINGS
I
THINK
THAT
WE
GONNA
SAY
ARE
REALLY
GREAT
ABOUT
OUR
OUR
OUR
NEW
PRODUCT
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0148872_0149481.lab"
AND
I'VE
BEEN
LOOKING
AROUND
UM
AT
WHAT
DESIGNS
EVERY
YEAR
DIFFERENT
THINGS
ARE
POPULAR
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149481_0149939.lab"
AND
IN
MY

THIS

I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
FRUIT
AND
VEGETABLE
SHAPES
ARE
REALLY
POPULAR
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0149939_0150324.lab"
AND
PEOPLE
ARE
TIRED
OF
HARD
PLASTIC
AND
HARD
METAL
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150324_0150982.lab"
THEY
ARE
MORE
BACK
INTO
SOFT
FEEL
SPONGY
FEELING
THINGS
THINGS
WITH
MAYBE
A
LITTLE
CLOTH
ON
THEM
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0150982_0151470.lab"
SO
THOSE
ARE
THINGS
MAYBE
WE
WANNA
LOOK
AT
AS
FAR
AS
SALEABILITY
OF
THE
ITEM
.
"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0153245_0153284.lab"
MM-HMM

LIMIT

"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0155221_0155254.lab"
OKAY

"AMI_IS1009c_H03_FIO089_0155631_0155945.lab"

THAT
THAT'S

SO
WHY
DON'T
WE
PUT

"AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0026431_0026654.lab"

"AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0027036_0027745.lab"
FROM

ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT

.
"AMI_IS1009d_H00_FIE088_0028058_0029057.lab"
TO

THAT
UH
MAYBE
ONE

I
THINK
WE
COULD
DO
SOMETHING
REALLY
FUNNY
WITH

BECAUSE
THE

IS
KNOWN

BE
SLOW
AND
WE
COULD
HAVE
SOME
SORT
OF
LITTLE
COMIC
EFFECT
ON
OUR
MARKETING
ABOUT
HOW
THIS
IS
A
RAPID
SNAIL
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT

THAT
WOULD

"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0078888_0079032.lab"
THAT
WOULD
REALLY
WORK

"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0079032_0079093.lab"
SO
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0079632_0080257.lab"
I
THINK

BIG

"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0081579_0082128.lab"

OKAY

TAKE

YEAH
RIGHT
AWAY
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0114846_0115717.lab"
OKAY
WELL
UH
OBVIOUSLY
MY
METHOD
FOR
UH
S
M
THE
MARKETING
OF
THIS
THING
IS
FIRST
TO
ASK
THE
BIG
QUESTION
WILL
IT
SELL
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0115717_0116800.lab"
AND
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
SHOW
THIS
PROTOTYPE
TO
PEOPLE
FROM
VARIOUS
AGE
AND
SOCIO
ECONOMIC
GROUPS
AND
SEE
ABOUT
ANY
FINE
TUNING
THAT
MAYBE
LITTLE
THINGS
WE
HAVEN'T
THOUGHT
OF
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0116800_0117268.lab"
WE
CAN'T
ACCEPT
EVERY
SUGGESTION
OF
COURSE
BUT
MAYBE
WE
JUST
NEED
TO
GET
A
FEW
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117268_0117552.lab"
AND
SHOW
THE
THE
PROTOTYPE
TO
CONSUMER
RESEARCH
GROUPS
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0117552_0118356.lab"
WE
DON'T
S
WANT
SOMEBODY
TO
SUDDENLY
COME
TO
US
AND
TELL
US
THAT
THIS
BUTTON
IS
TOXIC
AND
YOU
KNOW
SOME
CHILD
WILL
SWALLOW
IT
AND
THEN
WE
WON'T
SELL
ANY
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118356_0118628.lab"
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
GET
SOME
INPUT
FROM
THOSE
PEOPLE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0118628_0119064.lab"
AND
THEN
AFTER
THAT
WE
JUST
HAVE

GO
WITH
OUR
BEST
INTUITION
AND
YOU
KNOW
WE
LIKE
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119064_0119388.lab"
WE
THINK
IT'S
GOOD
WE'RE
GONNA
GET
BEHIND

AND
SELL
IT

"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119388_0119535.lab"

NEXT
SLIDE
PLEASE

"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0119781_0120514.lab"
OKAY
NOW
THE
THINGS
THAT
I
WAS
THINKING
AND
TH
MY
WISH
LIST
HAS
REALLY
BEEN
REALISED
IN
THIS
PROTOTYPE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120514_0120928.lab"
I
WANTED
THE
SHAPE
TO
BE
BIOMORPHIC
I
DIDN'T
WANT
ANYTHING
WITH
ANGLES
AND
ALL
SQUARE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0120928_0121283.lab"
I
WANTED
IT
TO
BE
COMFY
AND
ROUNDY
SO
WE
WE'VE
GOT
THAT
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121283_0121644.lab"
THE
SIZE
IS
SMALL
THE
COLOUR'S
BRIGHT
AND
WARM
WHICH
IS
WHAT
WE
WANTED
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0121644_0122239.lab"
WE
WANTED
THE
FEEL
TO
BE
AS
SOFT
AS
POSSIBLE
WE'LL
HAVE
THE
SOFT
BUTTONS
AND
THE
WAY
THIS
IS
SHAPED
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122239_0122686.lab"
EVEN
THOUGH
IT'S
GONNA
BE
HARD
PLASTIC
IT
FEELS
GOOD
IN
YOUR
HAND
SO
THAT'S
NICE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0122686_0123207.lab"
AND
FUNCTIONALITY
I
PUT
LAST
ON
MY
LIST
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
AREN'T
GOING
TO
USE
IT
BEFORE
THEY
BUY
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0123207_0124124.lab"
SO
PARADOXICALLY
THE
OTHER
FEATURES
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THE
LOOK
THE
FEEL
UM
AND
THE
SHAPE
THAT'S
WHAT
PEOPLE
ARE
GONNA
GET
IN
THE
STORE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124124_0124344.lab"
THEY
DON'T
HAVE
A
TELEVISION
IN
THE
STORE
THEY
CAN'T
PLAY
WITH
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124378_0124658.lab"
UM
SO
THEY'LL
BE
OUR
MAIN
SELLING
POINTS
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0124658_0125417.lab"
SO
UM
TH
THOSE
HAVE
BEEN
FULFILLED
BY
YOUR
PROTOTYPE
AND
GO
AHEAD
TO
THE
NEXT
SLIDE
PLEASE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0125417_0126043.lab"
OKAY
SO
UM
THE
SHAPE
UM
I
THINK
IS
A
A
ONE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0126043_0126301.lab"
THAT'S
REALLY
REALLY
EXCELLENT
SHAPE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0126301_0127341.lab"
THE
SIZE
IS
SMALL
UM
AND
TH
THESE
POINTS
ARE
IN
THE
IMPORTANCE
FOR
THE
FOR
THE
MARKETING
THESE
AREN'T
I
IN
HOW
I
FEEL
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127341_0127967.lab"
I
THINK
THAT
IT'S
I
THINK
THAT
IT'S
PLENTY
SMALL
ENOUGH
TO
SELL
BUT
I
THINK
WE'RE
SORT
OF
RIGHT
THE
SCALE
IS
ONE
TO
SEVEN
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0127967_0128408.lab"
I
THINK
WE'RE
SORT
OF
RIGHT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AS
FAR
AS
C
OTHER
COMPETITORS
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128456_0128620.lab"
AND
OUR
COLOUR
I
THINK
IS
GREAT
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128620_0128975.lab"
THE
COLOURS
ARE
BRIGHT
AND
WARM
AND
WE
REALLY
DO
GREAT
JOB
THERE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0128975_0129552.lab"
AND
GIVEN
UM
THE
CONSTRAINTS
THAT
WE
HAD
I
THINK
WE
GOT
IT
AS
SOFT
AS
POSSIBLE
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0129552_0130090.lab"
AND
THEN
FUNCTIONALITY
UM
I
THINK
YOU
DID
A
REALLY
GOOD
JOB
ON
FUNCTIONALITY
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0130090_0131014.lab"
OBVIOUSLY
WE
COULD
HAVE
AD
ADDED
DIFFERENT
FUNCTIONS
BUT
THEN
WE'D
DISTURB
SOMETHING
ELSE
SO
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
WE
GOT
TO
A
FIVE
OUT
OF
SEVEN
ON
ON
FUNCTIONALITY
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0131014_0131379.lab"
SO
I
THINK
THAT
BASICALLY
WE'VE
GOT
A
GREAT
PRODUCT
AND
WE
CAN
GET
OFF
AND
RUNNING
WITH
IT
.
"AMI_IS1009d_H03_FIO089_0131747_0131785.lab"

EUROS
TWENTY

SO
WE'VE
GOT
WE'VE
STILL
GOT
FOUR
EUROS
TO
GO
TO
SPEND

A
FEW
OF
ITS
FAVOURITE
CHARACTERISTICS
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0048367_0049213.lab"
UM
THE
ONLY
THING
WE
HAVE
TO
UH
LOOK
AFTER
IS
THAT
WE
USE
DIFFERENT
COLOURS
AND
DIFFERENT
LINE
WIDTH
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049213_0049607.lab"
UH
THERE'S
I
CAN
START
FROM
NOW
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049607_0049787.lab"
I
WILL
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0049787_0050177.lab"
YOU
CAN
USE
THIS
PEN
BY
HOLDING
IT
LIKE
A
LIKE
A
LITTLE
CHILD
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050177_0050801.lab"

HOLD
IT
LIKE
THIS
THE
SENSORS
WILL
GET
BLOCKED

THEN
THE
DRAWING
WON'T
GET
GOOD
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0050930_0051366.lab"
ANOTHER
THING
IS
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
UH
A
BIT
SLOW
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0051366_0051895.lab"

APPROPRIATE

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0052898_0052990.lab"
THEN
THE
LINE
WIDTH
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0052990_0053502.lab"
I
THINK
SEVEN
WILL

A
LITTLE
BIT
BUT
IT'S
CLOSE
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0057962_0058204.lab"
SO
WHAT

IT'S
THIS
IS
BIT
OF
THE
SWORDFISH
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0058204_0058330.lab"
YEAH
HE

THIS
EASILY

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059684_0059878.lab"
AH
IT'S
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0059878_0060429.lab"
AND
I'VE

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0063066_0063677.lab"
THIS
IS
TYPICALLY
A
UNDO
ACTION
I
THINK

UPSIDE
DOWN
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0064408_0065073.lab"
I
THINK
THAT'S
IT
BECAUSE
IF
YOU
WAN
AR
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
IT
LIKE
THIS
THEN
IT
WILL
BE
A
STRIPE

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065073_0065319.lab"
BUT
I
DON'T
KNOW
I'M
JUST

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0065568_0066182.lab"

THE
SMALLER
LINE

I
THINK
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0074838_0075126.lab"
BECAUSE

GOING
A

BETTER

S
HAUNTED

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110677_0110990.lab"
SO
WE'VE
GOT
THE
TOOL
UH
INTRODUCTION
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0110990_0111014.lab"
WE
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111125_0111506.lab"
MOVE
ALONG
TO
THE
PROJECT
FINANCE
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0111506_0112430.lab"
UM
AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
WE
UM
FOR
OUR
REMOTE
CONTROL
A
SELLING
PRICE
IS
UH
TWENTY
FIVE
EUROS
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112430_0112648.lab"
OUR
SELLING
PRICE
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112648_0112946.lab"
UH
OUR
PROFIT
AIM
IS
FIFTY
MILLION
EUROS
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0112946_0113775.lab"
UH
THAT'S
THE
LEAST
WE
HAVE
TO
GET
FROM
OUR
REMOTE
CONTROLS
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
WORK
TOGETHER
TO
REACH
OUR
AIMS
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0113775_0114717.lab"
UH
WE
CAN
DO
IT
INTERNATIONAL
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
FOCUS
ON
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
USERS
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
CULTURES
AND
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
TRENDS
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0114717_0115143.lab"
UM
BUT
THAT'S
ALL
IN
THE
LATER
STADIUM
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115233_0115933.lab"
OUR

UM
CAN

TWELVE
AND
A
HALF
EUROS
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0115933_0116883.lab"
SO
THAT'S
ALSO
A
POINT
WE
HAVE
TO
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
WE
WON'T
MAKE
REMOTE
CONTROLS
WITH
SMALL
TELEVISIONS
INSIDE
AND
STUFF
LIKE
THAT
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0116883_0117060.lab"
IT
WON'T
WORK
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0117060_0117394.lab"
SO
JUST
TRY
TO
REMEMBER
THESE
POINTS

SELLING

THAT'S
LEADS
US
TO
OUR
LITTLE

.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0119275_0119783.lab"
WE'VE

OR
TEN

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0128777_0129653.lab"
AND
YOU
CAN
UH
PROGRAM
I
THINK
EIGHT
DIFFERENT

IN

AND
YOU
CAN
USE
IT
FOR
YOUR
TELEVISION
ANYTHING
ELSE

"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0129653_0130326.lab"
AND
IT
ALSO
OPERATES
ON

RED
SO
YOU
HAVE
TO
GOT
THE
LITTLE
DEVICE
INSIDE
YOUR
ROOM
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H00_MTD009PM_0130326_0130868.lab"

"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0124708_0124779.lab"
AH
THERE
WE

"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0126746_0126820.lab"
WELL
WE
HAVE
A

"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0126909_0127508.lab"
KIND
OF
BROAD
T.
V.
AT
HOME
AND
A
D.
V.
D.

SO
WE
GOT
LIKE
A

OF

.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0127508_0128030.lab"
ONE

V.
D.

.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0128030_0128442.lab"
AND
I
THINK
IT'S
IT
WOULD
BE
BEST
TO
JUST
MAKE
ONE
REMOTE

THAT
CAN
OPERATE
THEM
ALL
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0130808_0130852.lab"

YOU

"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0136138_0136478.lab"
BUT
THAT
WOULD
BE
REALLY
GOOD
IF
WE
COULD
DO
THAT
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137108_0137155.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137424_0137534.lab"

IT
HAS
TO
BE
SHOCK
PROOF
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137663_0137689.lab"
\'CAUSE
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0137840_0138045.lab"
MY

TENDS
TO
FALL
A

.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0138186_0138224.lab"
SO
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140149_0140381.lab"
YEAH
ONE
OTHER
LITTLE
THING
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140381_0140763.lab"
THOUGHT
IT
MIGHT
BE
HANDY
TO

A
BATTERY
STATUS
DISPLAY
ON
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0140875_0140940.lab"
SO
YOU

"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141085_0141213.lab"
HOW
MUCH
IS
LEFT
IN
THE
BATTERY
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0141432_0141994.lab"
BUT
THEY'LL
ALSO
REALLY
DRAG
UP
THE
PRODUCTION
COSTS
SO
THINK
WE'LL
HAVE
TO
SEE
ABOUT
THAT
TOO
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0142216_0142437.lab"
BUT
MAYBE
JUST
A
LITTLE
LED
I
DON'T
KNOW
.
"AMI_TS3003a_H03_MTD012ME_0143847_0143889.lab"

GOING
UM
INTO
THE
FUNCTIONAL
DESIGN

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0007726_0009245.lab"
UM
IMPORTANT
THING
OF
THIS
PHASE
IS
THAT
WE'RE
GOING
TO
UH
TRY
TO
GET
AN
AGREEMENT
ABOUT
THE
USER
REQUIREMENTS
TECHNICAL
FUNCTION
DESIGN
AND
THE
WORKING
DESIGN
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009312_0009719.lab"
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
MOVE
ONTO
THE
SECOND
UH
PHASE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0009719_0009959.lab"

THERE'S
OUR
GHOST
MOUSE
AGAIN

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0011288_0012018.lab"
THAT
THAT
MEANS

LITTLE
TROUBLE
WITH

TROUBLE
WITH
THE
AIR
CONDITIONING
THAT'S
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
UH

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012157_0012339.lab"
IT'S
IN
WING
C.
AND
E.
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012339_0012853.lab"
SO
IT
SHOULD
BE
OVER
IN
A
IN
A
WHILE
COUPLE
OF
DAYS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0012853_0013438.lab"
BUT
IT'S
GOING
TO
BE
COLD
ANYWAY
SO
I
DON'T
THINK
YOU'RE
GONNA
NEED
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0013438_0013584.lab"

NOW
I
HOPE

I'M
THE

WE'VE

SUITABLE
FOR

V.
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0106739_0107827.lab"
UM
THAT'S
BECAUSE
UH
IT
WILL
BE
TOO
COMPLEX
AND
THE
TIME
TO
MARKET
WILL
BE
TOO
BIG
IF
WE
WANNA
HAVE
IT
UH
FOR
MORE
FUNCTIONS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0107878_0108096.lab"
SO
IT
HAS
TO
BE
SIMPLE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0108096_0108600.lab"
UH
ANOTHER
POINT
IS
WE
HAVE
TO
SKIP
THE
TELETEXT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0108600_0109601.lab"
BECAUSE
IN
THE
WORLD
OF

UPCOMING

UH
WE
THINK
TELETEXT
IS
GOING
TO
BE
UH
A
THING
OF
THE
PAST
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0109601_0110069.lab"
AND
UH
IT'S
A
FUNCTION
WE
DON'T
NEED
IN
OUR
REMOTE
CONTROL
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110183_0110739.lab"
UM
INTERNET
IS
ALSO
MENTIONED

FUNCTION
WE

USE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0110739_0111063.lab"
UH
MAYBE
ALSO
ON

IT
WILL
BE
AVAILABLE
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111183_0111672.lab"
ANOTHER
ONE
IS
UH
THE
CUSTOMER
IS
UH
FORTY
PLUS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0111672_0112578.lab"
UH
THAT'S
THE
THE
MARKET
WE
HAVE
TO
TO
TO
TARGET
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
DEVELOP
A
NEW
PRODUCT
WHICH
IS
SPECIALLY
DESIGNED
FOR
THE
YOUNGER
CUSTOMERS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0112666_0113257.lab"
UM
THIS
IS
UH
A
BIT
PITY
FOR
THE
MARKETING
UH
EXPERT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113257_0113682.lab"

ON
THE
THE
YOUNGER
PERSONS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0113682_0114200.lab"
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
FIND
A
MARKET
WHICH
IS
ABOVE
FORTY
PLUS
UH
BUT
WHICH
WILL
SUIT
OUR
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114304_0114648.lab"
UH

AND
THE
OTHER
WAY
ROUND
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0114648_0115449.lab"

WE
HAVE
TO

CORPORATE
IMAGE
UH
IN
OUR
PRODUCT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0115449_0116026.lab"
SO
IT
HAS
TO
BE
VISIBLE
IN

IN
THE
WAY
OUR

WORKS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116026_0116572.lab"

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116572_0116721.lab"
SO
I

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0116878_0117215.lab"
LET'S
HAVE
A
DISCUSSION

I
THINK

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0125551_0126238.lab"
I
THINK
WE
CAN
DO
A

WITH

THE
SIMPLE
BUTTONS
WHICH
WERE
ALSO
MENTIONED
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126238_0126970.lab"
UH
IF
WE
PUT
A

IN

WE
CAN
MAKE
A

WITH
UH
JUST
TWO
OR
THREE

.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0126970_0127577.lab"
OR
JUST
A

WE
WANNA

BECAUSE
IT
IS
FORTY
PERCENT
OF
THE

.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0127660_0128305.lab"
AND
UM
IF
YOU

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0128305_0128992.lab"

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0131668_0132456.lab"

UH
THAT

.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0140860_0141918.lab"

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0141918_0142419.lab"

"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145134_0145705.lab"
BECAUSE
I
DON'T
KNOW
IF
IT
WILL
BE
A
LOT
MORE
MONEY
TO

AS

BUT
I
DON'T
THINK
IT
WILL
BE
A

.
"AMI_TS3003b_H00_MTD009PM_0145856_0146019.lab"

A
TOUCHSCREEN
UH
WE'RE
GONNA
GO
WAY
ABOVE
THE
TWELVE
AND
A
HALF
EUROS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0088968_0089266.lab"
BUT
THE
IT
WOULDN'T
BE
VERY
ROBUST
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0089266_0089531.lab"
IT'S
VERY
FRAGILE
AND
YOU
CAN
GET
SCRATCHES
ON
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0090168_0090216.lab"
THAT'S
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0090492_0090533.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092373_0092777.lab"
OKAY
I'VE
GOT
A
PRESENTATION
ABOUT
THE
WORKING
DESIGN
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0092777_0093003.lab"
UM
FIRST
ABOUT
HOW
IT
WORKS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093003_0093099.lab"
IT'S
REALLY
SIMPLE
OF
COURSE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093099_0093285.lab"
EVERYBODY
KNOWS
HOW
A
REMOTE
WORKS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093285_0093468.lab"
THE
USER
PRESSES
A
BUTTON
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093468_0093999.lab"
THE
REMOTE
DETERMINES
WHAT
BUTTON
IT
IS
USES
THE
INFRARED
TO
SEND
A
SIGNAL
TO
THE
T.
V.
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0093999_0094301.lab"
THE
T.
V.
SWITCHES
TO
THE
FREQUENCY
OR
WHAT
FUNCTION
IT
IS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094422_0094811.lab"
SO
WE'VE
GOT
UM
THE
THE
PLATE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0094811_0095206.lab"
IT
GOTS
CONDUCTIVE
DISKS
FOR
EVERY
BUTTON
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0095206_0095983.lab"
WHEN
THE
USER
PRESSES
A
BUTTON
A
SIGNAL
GOT
SENT
GOES
TO
THE
LED
AND
TRANSMITS
TRANMI
TRANSMITS
ITS
TO
THE
T.
V.
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096005_0096340.lab"
IT'S
A
VERY
SIMPLE
DEVICE
TECHNICALLY
SPEAKING
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096340_0096614.lab"
SO
THIS
IS
A
SCHEMATIC
OVERVIEW
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096614_0096802.lab"
YOU'VE
GOT
THE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0096802_0097017.lab"
THE
POWER
SOURCE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097017_0097468.lab"
AND
UH
WHEN
A
BUTTON
GETS
PRESSED
ITS
GOES
TO
THE
CHIP
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0097468_0098059.lab"
THE
CHIP
UH
CONTROLS
THE
INFRARED
BULB
AND
PERF
PERHAPS
A
NORMAL
BULB
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098059_0098324.lab"
WHEN
YOU
PRESS
A
BUTTON
YOU
CAN
ACTUALLY
SEE
YOUR
PRESSED
BUTTON
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0098558_0099094.lab"
WELL
UM
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
USE
DEFAULT
MATERIALS
SIMPLE
PLASTICS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099094_0099441.lab"
KEEP
THE
INNER
WORKINGS
SIMPLE
SO
IT'S
ROBUST
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099441_0099841.lab"
UH
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
FOCUS
ON
AESTHETICS
THE
DESIGN
AND
THE
USER
INTERFACE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0099841_0100301.lab"
BECAUSE
IF
YOU'RE
GOING
TO
USE
HIGH
TECH
MATERIALS
THE
PRICE
IS
GOING
TO
GO
SKY
HIGH
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0100488_0101105.lab"
AND
UH
YOU
ONLY
HAVE
TO
DESIGN
A
REMOTE
ONCE
AND
IF
YOU
USE
HIGH
TECH
MATERIALS
IT
COME
BACK
IN
EVERY
PRODUCT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0101208_0102046.lab"
SO
IT'S
IN
MY
IDEA
IT'S
UH
IT'S
GONNA
BE
SMART
TO
INVEST
IN
DI
IN
DESIGN
AND
NOT
IN
UH
IN
THE
PRODUCT
ITSELF
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0102192_0102250.lab"
THAT'S
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0135277_0136073.lab"
I
THINK
THAT
IF
WE'RE
IF
WE
PUT
OUR
MARKETING
RIGHT
UM
WE
CAN
SELL
THIS
JUST
LIKE
UM
I
DON'T
KNOW
IF
YOU'VE
HEARD
ABOUT
IT
IN
THE
NEWS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136073_0136281.lab"
THE
THE
ELDERLY
MOBILE
PHONE
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0136466_0137249.lab"
YEAH
IF
WE
IF
WE
MAKE
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
JUST
L
WITH
THAT
IDEA
IN
MIND
WE
COULD
MAKE
TONS
OF
MONEY
I
THINK
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0137249_0137872.lab"
WE
DON'T
HAVE
TO
FOCUS
ON
ON
ON
THE
ON
THE
DESIGN
THEN
BUT
ON
FUNCTIONALITY
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0137872_0137940.lab"
WE
JUST
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138068_0138346.lab"
CHANGE
OUR
FOCUS
ON
THE
PROJECT
AND
I
THINK
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0138501_0138636.lab"
WE
CAN
UH
WE
CAN
SELL
THIS
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0147440_0147464.lab"
NO
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0151220_0151330.lab"
UH
THAT'S
A
GOOD
IDEA
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162606_0162693.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H02_MTD0010ID_0162693_0163275.lab"
AND
BESIDES
THAT
IT'S
UM
IF
WE'RE
GONNA
FOCUS
ON
ELDERLY
PEOPLE
THEY'LL
HAVE
TO

I
THINK
IF

TARGETING
PEOPLE
OF

THE
CHANCE
THAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
T.
V.
WITH

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0120976_0121278.lab"
WITHIN

SLIM

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0121414_0122133.lab"
IN

INDICATED

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122133_0122543.lab"
SO
I
THINK
IT'S
PRETTY
DUMB
TO
PUT
NO
TELETEXT
FEATURE
ON
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0122736_0122840.lab"
I'M

PRETTY
SMALL

WE'RE
JUST

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125042_0125083.lab"
PRETTY

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0125292_0125439.lab"

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0129558_0129973.lab"
AND
BESIDES
THAT
THEY'RE

THEY
DON'T
REALLY

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0130070_0130315.lab"
WHAT
THE

THEY'LL

NO

TO

FIVE
AGE

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0133626_0134077.lab"
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE

THEY
THEY
WANT
TO
HAVE
A
FANCY
REMOTE

.
"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0134196_0134605.lab"

AS

IT'S

THAT
IS

I
THINK
THERE'S
SIMPLY
NOT

ONE
OF
THE

A

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175413_0175845.lab"

OBVIOUSLY

ALL
THE

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0175939_0176153.lab"

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180192_0180428.lab"

WE
SHOULD
DO
SOME
RESEARCH
INTO

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0180531_0180733.lab"
WHAT
ELDERLY

TENDED

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0182965_0183188.lab"

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0183188_0183919.lab"
YOU
HAVE
IT

YOU

YOU

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0187315_0187701.lab"
I
THINK
SINCE
A

IS
HARD
TO

WE'RE

.
"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0188355_0188928.lab"
IT
MIGHT
BE
A
GOOD

"AMI_TS3003b_H03_MTD012ME_0189311_0189747.lab"
AND
IT
WOULDN'T
HAVE

THE
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
OUR
CONCEPTS

"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0092695_0092781.lab"
MM
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0093463_0093494.lab"
\'KAY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094506_0094825.lab"
SO
THESE
ARE
THE
POINTS
WE
HAVE
TO
DISCUSS
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0094960_0095318.lab"
UM
FIRST
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0095554_0096021.lab"
I
THINK
WE
CAN
TALK
ABOUT
THE
ENERGY
SOURCE
SINCE
THAT'S
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096165_0096908.lab"
HAS
A
PRETTY
BIG
INFLUENCE
ON
PRODUCTION
PRICE
UH
AND
IMAGE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0096908_0097011.lab"
UH
SO
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0097125_0097927.lab"
UH
F
I
THINK
FIRST
OF
ALL
WE
HAVE
TO
SEE
UH
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
INTRODUCE
KINETIC
ENERGY
IN
OUR
BUDGET
I
THINK
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0098232_0098266.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0098483_0098778.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0099066_0099103.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0099559_0099616.lab"
NO
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0099941_0100038.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0100038_0100106.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0100848_0100884.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0103768_0103813.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0106873_0106921.lab"
UH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0107399_0108077.lab"
UH
WELL
I
THINK
UH
ELDERLY
PEOPLE
JUST
LIKE
TO
HAVE
EVERYTHING
IN
PLACE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108077_0108773.lab"
AND
I
DON'T
THINK
THEY
THEY
LIKE
UH
REMOTES
JUST
LAYING
EVERYWHERE
IN
THEIR
ROOMS
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0108773_0109157.lab"
SO
MAYBE
A
DOCKING
STATION
WILL
HELP
THEM
GIVE
THE
REMOTE
A
PLACE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109241_0109369.lab"
AND
ALSO
WHAT
YOU
SAID
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0109369_0110186.lab"
UM
YOU
CAN
INTRODUCE
VOICE
RECOGNITION
BY
UH
FINDING
BACK
YOUR
REMOTE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110186_0110964.lab"
BUT
I
THINK
IT'S
UM
MORE
EFFICIENT
AND
CHEAPER
TO
PUT
IT
IN
THE
DOCKING
STATION
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0110964_0111441.lab"
SO
YOU
HAVE
A
BUT
BUTTON
ON
YOUR
DOCKING
STATION
WHICH
YOU
CAN
PUSH
AND
THEN
IT
STARTS
BEEPING
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0111626_0112214.lab"
AND
THEN
WE
CAN
WE
CAN
STILL
USE
THE
VOICE
RECOGNITION
BUT
MAYBE
THEN
FOR
ONLY
THE
THE
CHANNELS
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0112323_0112396.lab"
THAT'S
SAFE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0113024_0113083.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0113083_0113198.lab"
THAT'S
A
GOOD
POINT
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0114265_0114438.lab"
YEAH
SURE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0114438_0114477.lab"
GO
AHEAD
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0116786_0116827.lab"
NO
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0117647_0117690.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0118313_0118330.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121195_0121266.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121695_0121791.lab"
EASIER
TO
USE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0121791_0121961.lab"
NO
I
THINK
THAT'S
A
GOOD
POINT
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0124035_0124069.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0124348_0125054.lab"
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
THE
L.
C.
D.
SCREEN
WE
WANNA
USE
WITH
THE
EXTRA
INFORMATION
I
THINK
NOBODY
HAS
ANYTHING
AGAINST
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125054_0125507.lab"
BECAUSE
IT'S
JUST
UH
SOME
EXTRA
INFORMATION
AND
IT'S
EASY
TO
IGNORE
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125507_0125757.lab"
SO
IF
YOU
DON'T
WANNA
USE
IT
YOU
JUST
DON'T
USE
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0125842_0126889.lab"
AND
UM
YEAH
I
THINK
THE
UM
MAYBE
WE
HAVE
TO
UH
DISCARD
THE
VOICE
RECOGNITION
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0126889_0127431.lab"
BECAUSE
IT
WILL
INCREASE
COST
UH
SIGNIFI
UH
SIGNIFICANTLY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0127431_0127946.lab"
AND
I
DON'T
THINK
THE
I
DON'T
THINK
IT
WILL
BE
A
LOT
EASIER
TO
USE
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128122_0128372.lab"
SO
THAT
BRINGS
US
BACK
TO
THE
ENERGY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0128372_0129126.lab"
IF
WE
DON'T
HAVE
THE
VOICE
RECOGNITION
IT
WILL
IT
WON'T
USE
A
LOT
OF
ENERGY
TO
USE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0129126_0129227.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0129349_0130356.lab"
SO
IN
THAT
CASE
WE
COULD
USE
KINETIC
UH
ENERGY
BUT
I
THINK
JUST
A
SIMPLE
BATTERY
WHICH
YOU
CAN
RELOAD
ON
A
DOCKING
STATION
IS
JUST
AS
GOOD
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130356_0130466.lab"
AND
MUCH
CHEAPER
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130585_0130650.lab"
SO
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0130770_0131353.lab"
OKAY
LET
ME
JUST
CHOOSE
FOR
THE
BATTERY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0131353_0131484.lab"
THAT
BRINGS
US
TO
THE
CHIP
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0131750_0131847.lab"
JUST
THE
ADVANCED
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0132127_0132465.lab"
OKAY
ADVANCED
CHIP
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133009_0133455.lab"
AND
THEN
WE
GET
TO
THE
POINT
OF
THE
CASE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0133455_0134119.lab"
UM
WHICH
BRINGS
US
A
LITTLE
BIT
BACK
TO
MARKETING
AS
WELL
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134119_0134652.lab"
UH
IF
WE
WANNA
CHOOSE
FOR
WOOD
OR
THE
BLACK
AND
GREY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134652_0134732.lab"
OR
BOTH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0134908_0135723.lab"
UM
AS
WE
SAW
THERE
IS
NOT
YEAH
WOOD
IS
A
LOT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
TO
PRODUCE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0135723_0137033.lab"
UM
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WILL
ATTRACT
ELDERLY
PEOPLE
WHO
WANNA
HAVE
SOMETHING
EXCLUSIVE
WHICH
THEY
CAN
SHOW
OFF
TO
THEIR
GRANDKIDS
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0137033_0137275.lab"
LOOK
I'VE
GOT
A
NEW
REMOTE
CONTROL
AND
UH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138050_0138085.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138351_0138399.lab"
THAT'S
RIGHT
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138617_0138850.lab"
BUT
WITH
COLOUR
WAS
A
LOT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138850_0138904.lab"
OR
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0138987_0139038.lab"
YOU
DON'T
KNOW
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139212_0139515.lab"
I
THINK
SO
BECAUSE
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0139515_0140064.lab"
IT'S
A
LOT
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
TO
HANDLE
AND
TO
TO
GET
IN
THE
RIGHT
SHAPE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141387_0141421.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141783_0141896.lab"
CHANGE
THE
CASES
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0141896_0141939.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143261_0143413.lab"
YOU
CAN
SELL
THE
CASES
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143413_0143544.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143544_0143794.lab"
I
THINK
THAT'S
A
VERY
GOOD
OPTION
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0143794_0144768.lab"
BECAUSE
UM
THEN
YOU
CAN
ADVERTISE
AS
WELL
WITH
THE
GIVE
YOUR
GRANDFATHER
A
NEW
CASE
FOR
HIS
REMOTE
CONTROL
OR
WHATEVER
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0144813_0145796.lab"
BECAUSE
THAT'S
A
IT'S
SOMETHING
EXTRA
IT'S
SOMETHING
OTHER
REMOTES
DON'T
HAVE
WHICH
WE
CAN
GET
A
GREAT
ADVANTAGE
POINT
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145796_0145959.lab"
SO
AND
THEN
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THEM
WITH
COLOUR
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H00_MTD009PM_0145959_0146145.lab"
BLACK
AND
GREY
OTHER
COLOURS
AS

THAT

"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0155622_0156003.lab"

WHAT

"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0156003_0156236.lab"
IT
DOESN'T

"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186194_0186534.lab"
I

BY
BY
CHOOSING
A
CASE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0186534_0186785.lab"

THE
BASIS
YOU'RE
BUILDING
ON
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0187176_0187445.lab"
SO
I
COULD
DRAW
THEM
OUT

"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188024_0188151.lab"
LET'S
LOOK
AT

OH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0188973_0189358.lab"
IT'S
FROM
THE

IT'S
RATHER
NORMAL
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0189358_0189993.lab"
THE
THE
SINGLE
CURVED
SO
I'M
NOT
REALLY
SURE
WHAT
THEY'RE
GONNA
LOOK

BUT
I
THINK
IT'S
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0190736_0191632.lab"
SO
THIS

BE

A

"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0191855_0192274.lab"

GUESS

"AMI_TS3003c_H02_MTD0010ID_0193316_0193600.lab"

TH
THOSE

OBSOLETE

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0102499_0103267.lab"

I'M
WONDERING

OUR

NOT

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0116827_0117229.lab"

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117392_0117667.lab"

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0117667_0118175.lab"
I
THINK

WAS

YOU
PREFER
IT
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0119924_0120250.lab"
SO
THAT
DOESN'T
REALLY

WOULDN'T
PAY
EXTRA
FOR

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0120250_0120970.lab"

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137139_0137803.lab"

I

FACTOR
THERE
IS
THE
WOODEN

.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0137803_0138136.lab"
SO
IT
WOULDN'T

YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146246_0146670.lab"
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
LOOK
CAREFULLY
INTO
THE
DESIGN
THOUGH
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0146887_0147517.lab"
\'CAUSE
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
MAKE

THE
MORE

.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148300_0148355.lab"

THAT
WOULD

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0148901_0149184.lab"
WELL
I
WOULDN'T
DESIGN
A

.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0149655_0150094.lab"
WELL
NO
I
THINK
W
WE
SHOULD
JUST
WE
SHOULD
THEN
JUST
DESIGN
ONE
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0150237_0150867.lab"
ONE

IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
FANCY
WITH

WOOD
COVER
OR
THE
PLASTIC
ONE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0151065_0151305.lab"
SO
BUT
THAT
SHOULDN'T
BE
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
PROBLEM
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0152494_0153151.lab"
UM
I
HEARD
OUR

FLAT
SINGLE

DOUBLE
CURVED
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0153151_0153312.lab"
COULD
YOU
EXPLAIN
THAT
A
LITTLE
MORE
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0154001_0154034.lab"
MM-HMM
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0154727_0154954.lab"

WHAT

MEAN
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0155992_0156033.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0156264_0156539.lab"
SO
WE
CAN
PRETTY
MUCH
JUST
DO
WHATEVER

NO
JUST
TO

DOWN

"AMI_TS3003c_H03_MTD012ME_0158125_0158229.lab"
WE'LL
GO
FOR

YOU
COULD

YOUR

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0006236_0007073.lab"

WE
WILL
DO
SOME

NOT

THE

BUT
ALSO
THE
PROJECT
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0007073_0007473.lab"

THIS

WE
WILL
DISCUSS
UH
THE
LOOK
AND
FEEL
OF
THE
DESIGN
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0008951_0009616.lab"
THE
USABILITY

WE
WILL
DO
THE
PRODUCT
EVALUATION
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0009616_0010053.lab"
UM
IN

TO
DO
THAT
WE
HAVE
THIS
AGENDA
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010136_0010431.lab"
WE'LL
HAVE
THE
PROTOTYPE
PRESENTATION
FIRST
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010431_0010847.lab"
THEN
WE
WILL
SET
UP
SOME
EVALUATION
CRI
UM
CRITERIA
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0010847_0011128.lab"
THEN
WE
WILL
LOOK
AT
THE
FINANCE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011128_0011851.lab"
UH
WE
WILL
HAVE
TO
SEE
IF
EVERYTHING
WE
WANNA
DO
IS
ALSO
POSSIBLE
WITHIN
OUR
BUDGET
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0011851_0012264.lab"
BECAUSE
EVERYTHING
COSTS
MONEY
AND
THE
MORE

YOU
WANNA
HAVE
THE
MORE
MONEY
IT
WILL
COST
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012264_0012897.lab"
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
SEE
IF
IT
FITS
WITHIN
THE
TWELVE
AND
A
HALF
EURO
PER
REMOTE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0012941_0013106.lab"
BUT
WE
WILL
SEE
THAT
LATER
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013106_0013608.lab"
THEN
WE
WILL
DO
THE
PROJECT
UH
EVALUATION
AND
THE
CLOSING
AFTER
THAT
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013608_0013797.lab"
WE'VE
GOT
FORTY
MINUTES
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0013797_0014313.lab"
SO
WE
WILL
BE
FINISHED
AT
HALF
PAST
THREE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014313_0014458.lab"
BUT
FIRST
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0014580_0015059.lab"
WE
WILL
DO
THE
THIS
IS
PROTOTYPE
PRESENTATION
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0015059_0015536.lab"
SO
IF
SOME
YEAH
IF
SOMEBODY
WANTS
STEP
FORWARD
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0020627_0020674.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0026919_0027039.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0027039_0028033.lab"
UH
BUT
UM
I
THOUGHT
IN
A
FEW
MEETINGS
EARLIER
WE
UH
UH
TRIED
TO
KEEP
IT
UH
SIMPLE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028033_0028364.lab"
UH
JUST
A
FEW
BUTTONS
AND
LARGE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0028364_0028914.lab"
BUT
UH
I
THINK
THESE
ARE
ALTOGETHER
QUITE
A
QUITE
A
FEW
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0029107_0029558.lab"
SO
I'M
WONDERING
IF
WE
IF
WE
NEELY
REALLY
NEED
ALL
OF
THOSE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0030283_0030338.lab"
THAT'S
RIGHT

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0030660_0030695.lab"

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0034008_0034073.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0034073_0034143.lab"
IF
YOU
PUT
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0035472_0035572.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0035572_0035622.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036137_0036278.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036278_0036567.lab"
UH
TELETEXT
AND
SUBTITLES
ARE
YEAH
NECESSARY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0036567_0036608.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0037601_0037641.lab"
YEP
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0037802_0037877.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0037877_0038300.lab"
SO
WE
HAD
SOMEBODY
ABOUT
TH
INTERFA
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
BUTTONS
THERE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0038453_0038660.lab"
JUST
N
NORMAL
PLAIN
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0039654_0039801.lab"
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0039801_0039843.lab"
\'KAY

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0040283_0040330.lab"

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042516_0042770.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042770_0042859.lab"
THAT'S
NICE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0042859_0043583.lab"
THEN
BECAUSE
WE
ONLY
HAVE
THIRTY
MINUTES
LEFT
I
WILL
MOVE
ON
TO
THE
FINANCE
PART
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0043583_0044103.lab"
WHICH
IS
PRETTY
EXCITING
TO
SEE
IF
IT'S
ALL
POSSIBLE
WHAT
WE
WANNA
DO
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044103_0044313.lab"
AND
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0044514_0045184.lab"
THAT
WE'RE
GOING
TO
HAVE
A
PRETTY
HARD
TIME
PRODUCING
THIS
FOR
TWELVE
AND
A
HALF
EUROS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0045420_0046093.lab"
IF
WE
SEE
I
DON'T
KNOW
IF
I'VE
FILLED
IN
CORRECTLY
SO
JUST
CORRECT
ME
IF
YOU
SEE
UH
SOMETHING
WRONG
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046093_0046275.lab"
I
COUNTED
TWO
BATTERIES
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046275_0046449.lab"
BUT
MAYBE
WE
CAN
ALSO
USE
ONE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046449_0046571.lab"
I
DON'T
KNOW
IF
IT'S
POSSIBLE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046688_0046778.lab"
IT'S
RECHARGEABLE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0046778_0046829.lab"
THAT'S
RIGHT
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047159_0047280.lab"
OKAY
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047280_0047569.lab"
THAT'S
TWO
EUROS
OFF
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047569_0047771.lab"
WE
NEED
THE
ADVANCED
CHIP
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0047771_0047964.lab"
SO
THERE'S
NOT
MUCH
TO
UH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048184_0048445.lab"
TO
SAVE
THERE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048445_0048674.lab"
HERE
WE
HAVE
THE
SINGLE
CURVES
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0048674_0049330.lab"
UH
WE
CAN
SEE
THAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
UNCURVED
AND
THE
SINGLE
CURVED
IS
ONE
EURO
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0049330_0049416.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0049567_0050630.lab"
I
DON'T
KNOW
BUT
I
THINK
THE
SINGLE
CURVED
IS
GOOD
FOR
DESIGN
AND
ALSO
FOR
THE
DISPLAY
TO
HAVE
A
PROMINENT
PLACE
ON
THE
REMOTE
CONTROL
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050630_0050771.lab"
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
TO
KEEP
THAT
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0050894_0051207.lab"
THEN
WE
HAVE
THE
CASE
MATERIAL
SUPPLEMENTS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051207_0051288.lab"
IT'S
PLASTIC
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051288_0051551.lab"
IT'S
THE
CHEAPEST
ONE
WE
NEED
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051551_0051892.lab"
SO
THAT'S
UH
NOT
MUCH
TO
SAVE
EITHER
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0051892_0052253.lab"
BUT
THEN
THE
BIGGEST
COSTS
ARE
THE
BUTTONS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0052309_0053124.lab"
SO
MAYBE
WE
REALLY
SHOULD
TRY
TO
DISCARD
SOME
BUTTONS
TO
UH
KEEP
OUR
COSTS
LOW
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0053124_0053846.lab"
BECAUSE
YOU
HAVE
TO
WE
WILL
HAVE
TO
GET
THE
TWELVE
AND
A
HALF
EUROS
AT
THE
END
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0053846_0053922.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054091_0054498.lab"
SO
IF
WE
LET'S
FIR
FIRST
COUNT
THE
BUTTONS
WE
HAVE
NOW
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054498_0054741.lab"
BECAUSE
I
SIXTEEN
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0054741_0055171.lab"
NAH
THAT
WILL
BE
EVEN

EIGHTEEN

ALREADY

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0058157_0058347.lab"
\'CAUSE

FIFTEEN

FIFTEEN

KEEP

THIS

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0143629_0144030.lab"
I
THINK
IT

I

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0147824_0147921.lab"
I
THINK
THE
MOST
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148554_0148713.lab"
THAT'S
RIGHT

"AMI_TS3003d_H00_MTD009PM_0148713_0149057.lab"

MOST

I
THINK
THE

THERE'S
NO
OTHER
WAY

YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0078998_0079213.lab"

THAT'S
WHAT
I'M
WONDERING

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0079812_0079877.lab"
UM
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082155_0082340.lab"
WELL
SINCE
THE
MARKET
RESEARCH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0082453_0083439.lab"
INDICATED
THAT
OLDER
PEOPLE
SPEND
THEIR

EASIER
MORE

MAYBE
IT'S
FEASIBLE
TO
JUST
PUT
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
REMOTE
UP
A
LITTLE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0083439_0083715.lab"
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
WE
HAVE
THOSE
NICE
FEATURES
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0085527_0085761.lab"
IT
WOULD
BE
A
BE
A
PRETTY
RIGID
ONE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0089659_0089691.lab"
OR
B
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0089831_0090913.lab"
BASICALLY
BECOMING
A
CHOICE
BETWEEN

EITHER
A
GOOD

A
HIGHER

OR
JUST
ANY
OTHER
REMOTE
CONTROL
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0093820_0094017.lab"

HOW
DOES
SCROLL
WHEEL
WORK
HERE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096146_0096447.lab"
THAT
WOULD
BRING
UP
THE

WHEEL
ALSO
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0096574_0096836.lab"
INTEGRATED

BUT
YEAH
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0098258_0098523.lab"
I
THINK
THAT
WOULD
BE

THE
END
OF
OUR

.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0099189_0099267.lab"

BUT
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0104980_0105892.lab"
WELL
THINK
IT'S
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
TELETEXT
SUBTITLES
ARE
RIGHT
NOW
YOU
JUST
PUSH
THE
TELETEXT
BUTTON
GO

EIGHT
EIGHT
EIGHT
AND

DISAPPEARS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0105892_0106058.lab"

THE

STAY
THERE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106239_0106387.lab"
I
THINK
THAT'S
THE
CASE
ON
MOST
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0106964_0107498.lab"
WELL
THAT
COULD
BE
JUST

SCROLL

.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0107692_0108376.lab"
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
THAT
WOULD
BE
D
J
JUST
PRETTY
MUCH
NOT
AN

FOR
OLDER
PEOPLE
WHO
DON'T
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
A

IS
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0108535_0108604.lab"
HOLDING
A

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0108779_0109349.lab"

EXPECT

.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0109635_0109761.lab"
WITH
ONLY
FIVE

ON

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0109976_0110054.lab"

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0117002_0117143.lab"

A
PRETTY
BIG
SCROLL
WHEEL
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0128498_0128621.lab"
SO
THIS
IS
FIVE

.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0131765_0131884.lab"
RIGHT
NOW

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136474_0136803.lab"

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0136803_0137008.lab"

ALL
THESE

ARE
NOT

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0137451_0137601.lab"

SINCE

WE
JUST
HAVE
TO
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138097_0138255.lab"
I'D
RATHER
JUST
GO
TO

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138490_0138782.lab"
GET

A
A

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0138928_0139228.lab"

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145232_0145362.lab"
IT'S
PRETTY
DIFFERENT
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145362_0145959.lab"

THIS
IS
NOT

WE
WERE
MAKING
OUR
REMOTE
.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0145959_0146152.lab"
THIS
WILL
REALLY
REQUIRE
A

.
"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146322_0146482.lab"
TO
GET

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0146799_0147297.lab"
\'CAUSE

"AMI_TS3003d_H03_MTD012ME_0147297_0147426.lab"
THIS
